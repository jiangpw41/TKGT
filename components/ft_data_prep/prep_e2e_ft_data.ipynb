Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday.

He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: Home team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: The host Portland Trail Blazers defeated the rivial Denver Nuggets on Tuesday, 122 - 113. It was a big night for two Blazers in particular, as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J. McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland (36 - 38). Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks. The output came against his former team, from whom he was traded at the deadline. Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field, shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line. McCollum, meanwhile, shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points. The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense, as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night. Denver (35 - 39), meanwhile, saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers. Six Nuggets scored in double figures, and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double. Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up, recording 17 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. However, the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland. Foul trouble proved problematic as well, as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland. The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings, as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win. Portland will host Houston on Wednesday, while Denver will visit Charlotte on Thursday.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of Home team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

It was a big night for two Blazers in particular, as center Jusuf Nurkic and guard C.J. McCollum combined for 72 points for Portland (36 - 38). Nurkic contributed a career - high scoring output of 33 points to go along with a whopping 16 rebounds and three blocks. The output came against his former team, from whom he was traded at the deadline. Nurkic was absolutely deadly from the field, shooting 12 - of - 15 from the field and 9 - of - 11 at the free - throw line. McCollum, meanwhile, shot 15 - of - 24 for a game - high 39 points. The two were the centers of a red - hot Blazers offense, as the team shot over 49 percent from the field and reached the line 33 times on the night. Denver (35 - 39), meanwhile, saw slightly more balanced production from their scorers. Six Nuggets scored in double figures, and their own young big man nearly recorded a triple - double. Sophomore center Nikola Jokic cleaned up, recording 17 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. However, the team simply could not slow down the two hot scorers for Portland. Foul trouble proved problematic as well, as the Nuggets got to the line 20 times but gave up 33 free - throws to Portland. The game was hugely impactful on the playoff standings, as Portland was able to pass Denver for eighth in the conference thanks to the win.

Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

Corey Brewer and Josh Smith provided the offense down the stretch for Houston and, more importantly, the Rockets clamped down on defense.

The Clippers took a commanding 19 - point lead late in the third quarter and appeared to be on their way to clinching the first Western Conference Finals berth in franchise history. The Rockets, using a lineup without James Harden, embarked on a massive comeback in the fourth quarter. Corey Brewer and Josh Smith provided the offense down the stretch for Houston and, more importantly, the Rockets clamped down on defense. The Clippers' offense stagnated and could n't create the shots they were finding with ease through the first 36 minutes. Josh Smith, who was 2 - of - 12 from three point range in the series coming into Game 6, canned 4 out of 7 threes Thursday and finished with 19 points. The series will move back to Houston for the decisive Game 7 on Sunday. Time appeared to be winding down on Houston's season in the third quarter with Los Angeles' Blake Griffin making 360 degree layups and Chris Paul imposing his will. The Rockets never wavered, however, and fought their way back to send the series back to their home floor for Game 7. James Harden, the NBA's runner - up for MVP, did n't play in the fourth quarter. In addition to Smith and Brewer's strong play, Dwight Howard worked his way to a 20 - point, 21 - rebound performance over 40 minutes on the floor. It was one of the most stunning comebacks in franchise history, but it will be for not if the Rockets are unable to come away with a win Sunday. Los Angeles let a chance to advance to the Western Conference Finals slip away in front of a stunned home crowd. After routing the Rockets in the other two games at Staples Center this series, the Clippers seemingly lost their way late on Thursday. Despite holding Houston to 17 points in the third quarter, Los Angeles collapsed on the defensive end and allowed 40 points in the fourth. The Clippers missed their last 14 field goals before Paul's three pointer at the buzzer when the outcome had already been decided.

Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

Oklahoma City has won six straight games, making a defining run following the return of their stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to the lineup two weeks ago. Their win over the Suns was a drubbing that allowed the Thunder to play their starters limited minutes. Oklahoma City shot 48 percent from the field, but where they truly dominated the game was on the glass, collecting 63 rebounds compared to the Suns' 40 rebounds. The Suns also could n't keep the Thunder off the free - throw line, allowing them to put up 30 free points at the charity stripe. Oklahoma City will start a three - game road trip in Sacramento on Tuesday against the Kings. Phoenix has dropped five straight games and appear to be in a tailspin, but that could correct itself as they embark on an Eastern Conference road trip this week that could allow them to get back in the win column. While the Suns had Isaiah Thomas return to action Friday in their 105 - 103 loss to the Detroit Pistons, the team also played without Goran Dragic on Sunday, as he was forced to sit out with a lower - back strain. Gerald Green earned the spot start in Dragic's absence and finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes.

Oklahoma City has won six straight games, making a defining run following the return of their stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to the lineup two weeks ago. Their win over the Suns was a drubbing that allowed the Thunder to play their starters limited minutes. Oklahoma City shot 48 percent from the field, but where they truly dominated the game was on the glass, collecting 63 rebounds compared to the Suns' 40 rebounds. The Suns also could n't keep the Thunder off the free - throw line, allowing them to put up 30 free points at the charity stripe. Oklahoma City will start a three - game road trip in Sacramento on Tuesday against the Kings. Phoenix has dropped five straight games and appear to be in a tailspin, but that could correct itself as they embark on an Eastern Conference road trip this week that could allow them to get back in the win column. While the Suns had Isaiah Thomas return to action Friday in their 105 - 103 loss to the Detroit Pistons, the team also played without Goran Dragic on Sunday, as he was forced to sit out with a lower - back strain. Gerald Green earned the spot start in Dragic's absence and finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 26 minutes.

The game provided plenty of fireworks with several outstanding individual stat lines, but the best individual matchup of the night was between the big men. Dwight Howard and Al Horford seemed to bring out each other's best and virtually matched one another point for point and rebound and rebound. Howard finished with a season - high 30 points and added 16 rebounds, while Horford equaled him with a season - high 30 points and 14 rebounds. Due to the game remaining close throughout, both players also received a higher allotment of minutes than usual. The standoff between them also extended to the final statistics down low for both clubs, as they battled to a draw near the basket; Atlanta slightly outscored Houston in the paint, 50 - 46, while the Rockets nipped them in the rebounding department, 46 - 45. Besides Horford's outstanding effort, the Hawks also got a trio of 20 - point - plus efforts from some of their most dependable starters. Kent Bazemore, already a solid contributor in rebounds and assists, turned his scoring up several notches, collecting 26 points on the night along with four assists and three rebounds. Stalwarts Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap contributed a pair of 22 - point tallies, with the latter making it a double - double by hauling in 13 boards as well. The veteran power forward also added a season - high five blocks as he dominated a Houston defense that has been one of the league's weakest against opposing fours. The Hawks improved to 21 - 13 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They will now enjoy an extended break over the New Year's holiday and return to action in New York on Sunday. In addition to Howard's mammoth double - double, Jame Harden pitched in with one of his own, pouring in 26 points, while also impressively grabbing a season - high 10 boards and dishing out eight assists. Clint Capela was the third Rockets starter to accomplish the feat, posting 17 points and 10 rebounds. Trevor Ariza (10 points) and Patrick Beverley (nine points) rounded out the starting five's contributions with modest outputs, while Ty Lawson continued his recent stretch of improved play by pacing the Houston bench with 14 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal.

The game provided plenty of fireworks with several outstanding individual stat lines, but the best individual matchup of the night was between the big men. Dwight Howard and Al Horford seemed to bring out each other's best and virtually matched one another point for point and rebound and rebound. Howard finished with a season - high 30 points and added 16 rebounds, while Horford equaled him with a season - high 30 points and 14 rebounds. Due to the game remaining close throughout, both players also received a higher allotment of minutes than usual. The standoff between them also extended to the final statistics down low for both clubs, as they battled to a draw near the basket; Atlanta slightly outscored Houston in the paint, 50 - 46, while the Rockets nipped them in the rebounding department, 46 - 45. Besides Horford's outstanding effort, the Hawks also got a trio of 20 - point - plus efforts from some of their most dependable starters. Kent Bazemore, already a solid contributor in rebounds and assists, turned his scoring up several notches, collecting 26 points on the night along with four assists and three rebounds. Stalwarts Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap contributed a pair of 22 - point tallies, with the latter making it a double - double by hauling in 13 boards as well. The veteran power forward also added a season - high five blocks as he dominated a Houston defense that has been one of the league's weakest against opposing fours. The Hawks improved to 21 - 13 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They will now enjoy an extended break over the New Year's holiday and return to action in New York on Sunday. In addition to Howard's mammoth double - double, Jame Harden pitched in with one of his own, pouring in 26 points, while also impressively grabbing a season - high 10 boards and dishing out eight assists. Clint Capela was the third Rockets starter to accomplish the feat, posting 17 points and 10 rebounds. Trevor Ariza (10 points) and Patrick Beverley (nine points) rounded out the starting five's contributions with modest outputs, while Ty Lawson continued his recent stretch of improved play by pacing the Houston bench with 14 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. The Rockets fell to 16 - 17 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division.

The game provided plenty of fireworks with several outstanding individual stat lines, but the best individual matchup of the night was between the big men. Dwight Howard and Al Horford seemed to bring out each other's best and virtually matched one another point for point and rebound and rebound. Howard finished with a season - high 30 points and added 16 rebounds, while Horford equaled him with a season - high 30 points and 14 rebounds. Due to the game remaining close throughout, both players also received a higher allotment of minutes than usual. The standoff between them also extended to the final statistics down low for both clubs, as they battled to a draw near the basket; Atlanta slightly outscored Houston in the paint, 50 - 46, while the Rockets nipped them in the rebounding department, 46 - 45. Besides Horford's outstanding effort, the Hawks also got a trio of 20 - point - plus efforts from some of their most dependable starters. Kent Bazemore, already a solid contributor in rebounds and assists, turned his scoring up several notches, collecting 26 points on the night along with four assists and three rebounds. Stalwarts Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap contributed a pair of 22 - point tallies, with the latter making it a double - double by hauling in 13 boards as well. The veteran power forward also added a season - high five blocks as he dominated a Houston defense that has been one of the league's weakest against opposing fours. The Hawks improved to 21 - 13 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They will now enjoy an extended break over the New Year's holiday and return to action in New York on Sunday. In addition to Howard's mammoth double - double, Jame Harden pitched in with one of his own, pouring in 26 points, while also impressively grabbing a season - high 10 boards and dishing out eight assists. Clint Capela was the third Rockets starter to accomplish the feat, posting 17 points and 10 rebounds. Trevor Ariza (10 points) and Patrick Beverley (nine points) rounded out the starting five's contributions with modest outputs, while Ty Lawson continued his recent stretch of improved play by pacing the Houston bench with 14 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. The Rockets fell to 16 - 17 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division.

The game provided plenty of fireworks with several outstanding individual stat lines, but the best individual matchup of the night was between the big men. Dwight Howard and Al Horford seemed to bring out each other's best and virtually matched one another point for point and rebound and rebound. Howard finished with a season - high 30 points and added 16 rebounds, while Horford equaled him with a season - high 30 points and 14 rebounds. Due to the game remaining close throughout, both players also received a higher allotment of minutes than usual. The standoff between them also extended to the final statistics down low for both clubs, as they battled to a draw near the basket; Atlanta slightly outscored Houston in the paint, 50 - 46, while the Rockets nipped them in the rebounding department, 46 - 45. Besides Horford's outstanding effort, the Hawks also got a trio of 20 - point - plus efforts from some of their most dependable starters. Kent Bazemore, already a solid contributor in rebounds and assists, turned his scoring up several notches, collecting 26 points on the night along with four assists and three rebounds. Stalwarts Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap contributed a pair of 22 - point tallies, with the latter making it a double - double by hauling in 13 boards as well. The veteran power forward also added a season - high five blocks as he dominated a Houston defense that has been one of the league's weakest against opposing fours. The Hawks improved to 21 - 13 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They will now enjoy an extended break over the New Year's holiday and return to action in New York on Sunday. In addition to Howard's mammoth double - double, Jame Harden pitched in with one of his own, pouring in 26 points, while also impressively grabbing a season - high 10 boards and dishing out eight assists. Clint Capela was the third Rockets starter to accomplish the feat, posting 17 points and 10 rebounds.

The game provided plenty of fireworks with several outstanding individual stat lines, but the best individual matchup of the night was between the big men. Dwight Howard and Al Horford seemed to bring out each other's best and virtually matched one another point for point and rebound and rebound. Howard finished with a season - high 30 points and added 16 rebounds, while Horford equaled him with a season - high 30 points and 14 rebounds. Due to the game remaining close throughout, both players also received a higher allotment of minutes than usual. The standoff between them also extended to the final statistics down low for both clubs, as they battled to a draw near the basket; Atlanta slightly outscored Houston in the paint, 50 - 46, while the Rockets nipped them in the rebounding department, 46 - 45. Besides Horford's outstanding effort, the Hawks also got a trio of 20 - point - plus efforts from some of their most dependable starters. Kent Bazemore, already a solid contributor in rebounds and assists, turned his scoring up several notches, collecting 26 points on the night along with four assists and three rebounds. Stalwarts Jeff Teague and Paul Millsap contributed a pair of 22 - point tallies, with the latter making it a double - double by hauling in 13 boards as well. The veteran power forward also added a season - high five blocks as he dominated a Houston defense that has been one of the league's weakest against opposing fours. The Hawks improved to 21 - 13 and remain atop the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division. They will now enjoy an extended break over the New Year's holiday and return to action in New York on Sunday. In addition to Howard's mammoth double - double, Jame Harden pitched in with one of his own, pouring in 26 points, while also impressively grabbing a season - high 10 boards and dishing out eight assists. Clint Capela was the third Rockets starter to accomplish the feat, posting 17 points and 10 rebounds. Trevor Ariza (10 points) and Patrick Beverley (nine points) rounded out the starting five's contributions with modest outputs, while Ty Lawson continued his recent stretch of improved play by pacing the Houston bench with 14 points, four assists, a rebound and a steal. The Rockets fell to 16 - 17 and remain in fourth place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division.

Jimmy Butler's first career triple - double was not enough to salvage a win for the Chicago Bulls as they succumbed to the visiting Detroit Pistons. This was a significant game for both teams but the Bulls especially, as a win could have brought them within half a game, or even a tie for the last playoff spot. However, the Pistons did a great job to bounce back from a tough loss at home to the Mavericks on Friday, as they were relentless down the stretch to come out on top. Detroit remains in seventh place in the East, half a game ahead of Indiana and 3 games ahead of ninth place Chicago. The Bulls have six games remaining, while the Pistons have five, as the battle for the last three spots in the East remains a close one. Reggie Jackson hit four clutch free throws in the last 20 seconds to help secure the win for the Pistons. Jackson totaled 22 points (6 - 17 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), four rebounds, four assists and one steal but also gave up six turnovers, in 35 minutes of action. Tobias Harris chipped in 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), seven rebounds, four assists, two steals and one blocked shot, in 38 minutes; while Andre Drummond recorded his 64th double - double of the season, with 11 points and 11 rebounds, along with four assists and two steals, in 28 minutes. The Pistons shot 42 percent from the field, including 50 percent from long range en route to the win. Jimmy Butler did it all for Chicago, as he tallied 28 points (10 - 25 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), 17 rebounds, 12 assists, three steals and two blocked shots, in 39 minutes. Butler's first career triple - double was not enough as only two other Bulls players scored in double digits, while the team shot 37 percent from the field.

Jimmy Butler's first career triple - double was not enough to salvage a win for the Chicago Bulls as they succumbed to the visiting Detroit Pistons. This was a significant game for both teams but the Bulls especially, as a win could have brought them within half a game, or even a tie for the last playoff spot. However, the Pistons did a great job to bounce back from a tough loss at home to the Mavericks on Friday, as they were relentless down the stretch to come out on top. Detroit remains in seventh place in the East, half a game ahead of Indiana and 3 games ahead of ninth place Chicago. The Bulls have six games remaining, while the Pistons have five, as the battle for the last three spots in the East remains a close one. Reggie Jackson hit four clutch free throws in the last 20 seconds to help secure the win for the Pistons. Jackson totaled 22 points (6 - 17 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), four rebounds, four assists and one steal but also gave up six turnovers, in 35 minutes of action. Tobias Harris chipped in 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), seven rebounds, four assists, two steals and one blocked shot, in 38 minutes; while Andre Drummond recorded his 64th double - double of the season, with 11 points and 11 rebounds, along with four assists and two steals, in 28 minutes. The Pistons shot 42 percent from the field, including 50 percent from long range en route to the win. Jimmy Butler did it all for Chicago, as he tallied 28 points (10 - 25 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), 17 rebounds, 12 assists, three steals and two blocked shots, in 39 minutes. Butler's first career triple - double was not enough as only two other Bulls players scored in double digits, while the team shot 37 percent from the field. Pau Gasol added 16 points, 14 rebounds, four blocked shots and three steals, in 34 minutes, while Aaron Brooks tallied 14 points in 16 minutes off the bench. Derrick Rose (elbow) and Taj Gibson (ribs) were both absent from the contest. The Bulls will look to get right back on track as they play in Milwaukee on Sunday.

Jimmy Butler's first career triple - double was not enough to salvage a win for the Chicago Bulls as they succumbed to the visiting Detroit Pistons. This was a significant game for both teams but the Bulls especially, as a win could have brought them within half a game, or even a tie for the last playoff spot. However, the Pistons did a great job to bounce back from a tough loss at home to the Mavericks on Friday, as they were relentless down the stretch to come out on top. Detroit remains in seventh place in the East, half a game ahead of Indiana and 3 games ahead of ninth place Chicago. The Bulls have six games remaining, while the Pistons have five, as the battle for the last three spots in the East remains a close one. Reggie Jackson hit four clutch free throws in the last 20 seconds to help secure the win for the Pistons. Jackson totaled 22 points (6 - 17 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), four rebounds, four assists and one steal but also gave up six turnovers, in 35 minutes of action. Tobias Harris chipped in 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), seven rebounds, four assists, two steals and one blocked shot, in 38 minutes; while Andre Drummond recorded his 64th double - double of the season, with 11 points and 11 rebounds, along with four assists and two steals, in 28 minutes. The Pistons shot 42 percent from the field, including 50 percent from long range en route to the win. Jimmy Butler did it all for Chicago, as he tallied 28 points (10 - 25 FG, 1 - 7 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT), 17 rebounds, 12 assists, three steals and two blocked shots, in 39 minutes. Butler's first career triple - double was not enough as only two other Bulls players scored in double digits, while the team shot 37 percent from the field. Pau Gasol added 16 points, 14 rebounds, four blocked shots and three steals, in 34 minutes, while Aaron Brooks tallied 14 points in 16 minutes off the bench.

Jimmy Butler's first career triple - double was not enough to salvage a win for the Chicago Bulls as they succumbed to the visiting Detroit Pistons. This was a significant game for both teams but the Bulls especially, as a win could have brought them within half a game, or even a tie for the last playoff spot. However, the Pistons did a great job to bounce back from a tough loss at home to the Mavericks on Friday, as they were relentless down the stretch to come out on top. Detroit remains in seventh place in the East, half a game ahead of Indiana and 3 games ahead of ninth place Chicago. The Bulls have six games remaining, while the Pistons have five, as the battle for the last three spots in the East remains a close one. Reggie Jackson hit four clutch free throws in the last 20 seconds to help secure the win for the Pistons.

Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday.

The Heat had lost five of their last six before grabbing this road win. Miami got the job done against the Jazz, largely due to an impressive night from Dwyane Wade, who scored 29 points (10 - 16 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 8 - 12 FG) to go with seven assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block in 35 minutes. Chris Bosh and Luol Deng were the only other players to hit double figures, with Bosh scoring 22 points (9 - 16 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) Deng scoring 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT). The Heat will look to keep it going against the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night. The Jazz were only able to get 10 minutes from Derrick Favors in this one, as he left the game with a sprained ankle. Losing the big man obviously hurt them, and it forced Rudy Gobert into extended action. Gobert scored nine points (2 - 2 FG, 5 - 6 FT) to go with 11 rebounds, five blocks, four assists and one steal in 26 minutes. Enes Kanter had a nice night for the Jazz as well, putting up 25 points (10 - 17 FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) to go with eight rebounds.

Miami got the job done against the Jazz, largely due to an impressive night from Dwyane Wade, who scored 29 points (10 - 16 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 8 - 12 FG) to go with seven assists, three rebounds, one steal and one block in 35 minutes. Chris Bosh and Luol Deng were the only other players to hit double figures, with Bosh scoring 22 points (9 - 16 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT) Deng scoring 14 points (5 - 7 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 3 - 4 FT). The Heat will look to keep it going against the Chicago Bulls on Sunday night. The Jazz were only able to get 10 minutes from Derrick Favors in this one, as he left the game with a sprained ankle. Losing the big man obviously hurt them, and it forced Rudy Gobert into extended action. Gobert scored nine points (2 - 2 FG, 5 - 6 FT) to go with 11 rebounds, five blocks, four assists and one steal in 26 minutes.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: visiting team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: The visiting Houston Rockets took down the host Phoenix Suns on Wednesday, 125 - 111.

Starting point guard George Hill scored 20 - plus points for the second straight night, putting up a team - high 25 points to go along with six rebounds and four assists, while starting shooting guard Rodney Hood managed to record 22 points and seven rebounds of his own.

Harrison Barnes, the team's high scorer on the night, managed to score just 14 points, while Dallas' starting backcourt consisting of Deron Williams and Wesley Matthews scored only 12 points a piece.

As usual, it was a team effort that gave the Hawks the win, with seven players finishing in double digits, including Dennis Schroder's 15 points and eight assists in 24 minutes off the bench. Despite playing a somewhat limited role off the bench, Schroder has averaged 16 points and 9 assists in just 29 minutes per game over his last three outings. The Hawks do n't have an MVP candidate on their roster, but if they keep beating the other top teams in the NBA, it makes the idea of extending the Player of the Month Award that was given to the entire starting five for their perfect 170 run in January an intriguing notion to suggest for the MVP award that is historically only given to one player. They have an 11 - game lead on the second - place Chicago Bulls, and they're the only team in the NBA to already have a playoff spot secured. The Cavaliers are no slouches, but they've struggled a little lately, winning just two of their last five games. They had trouble protecting the ball Friday, as Kyrie Irving coughed up the ball five times, and LeBron James tied his career high for turnovers in regulation by losing the ball nine times. The Hawks forced a lot of those turnovers with great pressure defense to force the ball out of the Cavs' playmakers' hands, and they scored 20 easy points off the Cavs' 18 turnovers. While King James struggled, James Harden was busy putting up a triple - double on the Detroit Pistons on Friday, as both players remain two of the top players in consideration for the MVP award this season, and the narratives about who is more deserving change from night to night as they trade off impressive performances.

As usual, it was a team effort that gave the Hawks the win, with seven players finishing in double digits, including Dennis Schroder's 15 points and eight assists in 24 minutes off the bench. Despite playing a somewhat limited role off the bench, Schroder has averaged 16 points and 9 assists in just 29 minutes per game over his last three outings.

The Cavaliers are no slouches, but they've struggled a little lately, winning just two of their last five games. They had trouble protecting the ball Friday, as Kyrie Irving coughed up the ball five times, and LeBron James tied his career high for turnovers in regulation by losing the ball nine times. The Hawks forced a lot of those turnovers with great pressure defense to force the ball out of the Cavs' playmakers' hands, and they scored 20 easy points off the Cavs' 18 turnovers.

As usual, it was a team effort that gave the Hawks the win, with seven players finishing in double digits, including Dennis Schroder's 15 points and eight assists in 24 minutes off the bench. Despite playing a somewhat limited role off the bench, Schroder has averaged 16 points and 9 assists in just 29 minutes per game over his last three outings.

The Cavaliers are no slouches, but they've struggled a little lately, winning just two of their last five games. They had trouble protecting the ball Friday, as Kyrie Irving coughed up the ball five times, and LeBron James tied his career high for turnovers in regulation by losing the ball nine times. The Hawks forced a lot of those turnovers with great pressure defense to force the ball out of the Cavs' playmakers' hands, and they scored 20 easy points off the Cavs' 18 turnovers.

As usual, it was a team effort that gave the Hawks the win, with seven players finishing in double digits, including Dennis Schroder's 15 points and eight assists in 24 minutes off the bench. Despite playing a somewhat limited role off the bench, Schroder has averaged 16 points and 9 assists in just 29 minutes per game over his last three outings. The Hawks do n't have an MVP candidate on their roster, but if they keep beating the other top teams in the NBA, it makes the idea of extending the Player of the Month Award that was given to the entire starting five for their perfect 170 run in January an intriguing notion to suggest for the MVP award that is historically only given to one player. They have an 11 - game lead on the second - place Chicago Bulls, and they're the only team in the NBA to already have a playoff spot secured. The Cavaliers are no slouches, but they've struggled a little lately, winning just two of their last five games. They had trouble protecting the ball Friday, as Kyrie Irving coughed up the ball five times, and LeBron James tied his career high for turnovers in regulation by losing the ball nine times. The Hawks forced a lot of those turnovers with great pressure defense to force the ball out of the Cavs' playmakers' hands, and they scored 20 easy points off the Cavs' 18 turnovers. While King James struggled, James Harden was busy putting up a triple - double on the Detroit Pistons on Friday, as both players remain two of the top players in consideration for the MVP award this season, and the narratives about who is more deserving change from night to night as they trade off impressive performances.

Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes.

With the second seed guaranteed, and a three - game losing streak having been broken on Tuesday night, coach Gregg Popovich opted to rest the majority of his starters. San Antonio's starting five resembled a unit that could easily be envisioned playing in the fourth quarter of a mid - October exhibtion, with Kyle Anderson, Andre Miller, Kyle Anderson, Danny Green and Boban Marjanovic taking the floor. Despite essentially playing with second and third units, the Spurs were impressively able to garner a road victory against a Dallas team that could have potentially improved its playoff positioning with a victory. San Antonio was led by Marjanovic's 22 - point, 12 - rebound double - double that also included two blocks and an assist. Jonathan Simmons was next, tallying 19 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals in 31 minutes off the bench. Marjanovic's and Simmons' point totals were notably career highs. Anderson contributed a double - double of his own, managing 15 points, 10 rebounds, four assists and five steals. Danny Green supplied 12 points, three assists, two rebounds and a steal. The Spurs finish atop the Western Conference's Southwest Division, with their playoff opponent still to be determined as of this writing. Dallas was led by a 22 - point effort off the bench from Raymond Felton, who also supplied four rebounds, two assists and a steal. Dirk Nowitzki pitched in with 19 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Deron Williams totaled 13 points, seven assists and two rebounds. Wesley Matthews amassed 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block. The Mavericks finish in third place in the Western Conference's Southwest Division.

The Bulls literally stole one from the Kings, as Dwyane Wade came up with two huge steals in the last minute to seal the deal for Chicago. First Wade stole the ball then raced down floor but missed a dunk to go ahead by two, however a foul was called against DeMarcus Cousins on the play to put Wade at the line. Wade missed the first of two free throws but hit the second to put his squad up 100 - 99. The Kings then took a timeout with 14 seconds on the clock. Out of the timeout, they inbounded the ball to Cousins at the three - point line, and he proceeded to take it into the paint, but as he was backing down his defender, Wade swooped in for the game saving steal, and raced away, passing the ball ahead for a dunk which put the game out of reach. The Bulls (22 - 23) really needed this one, as they were coming off two ugly losses. Wade had a rough start to the game but ended up coming through, with a team - high 30 points, to go along with six rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals. Three other players scored in double digits for the Bulls, led by Jimmy Butler's 23 points. Paul Zipser came up big for Chicago, as he chipped in 13 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting, in 23 minutes off the bench, while Nikola Mirotic added 11 points off the bench. The Bulls will look to build on this win, as they head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Kings (18 - 27) were dealt a heartbreaker, as the foul on Wade's would - be go - ahead dunk was a questionable one, and will likely be mentioned in Sunday's L2M report.

Out of the timeout, they inbounded the ball to Cousins at the three - point line, and he proceeded to take it into the paint, but as he was backing down his defender, Wade swooped in for the game saving steal, and raced away, passing the ball ahead for a dunk which put the game out of reach. The Bulls (22 - 23) really needed this one, as they were coming off two ugly losses. Wade had a rough start to the game but ended up coming through, with a team - high 30 points, to go along with six rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals.

Paul Zipser came up big for Chicago, as he chipped in 13 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting, in 23 minutes off the bench, while Nikola Mirotic added 11 points off the bench. The Bulls will look to build on this win, as they head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Tuesday.

Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday.

The Bulls literally stole one from the Kings, as Dwyane Wade came up with two huge steals in the last minute to seal the deal for Chicago. First Wade stole the ball then raced down floor but missed a dunk to go ahead by two, however a foul was called against DeMarcus Cousins on the play to put Wade at the line. Wade missed the first of two free throws but hit the second to put his squad up 100 - 99. The Kings then took a timeout with 14 seconds on the clock. Out of the timeout, they inbounded the ball to Cousins at the three - point line, and he proceeded to take it into the paint, but as he was backing down his defender, Wade swooped in for the game saving steal, and raced away, passing the ball ahead for a dunk which put the game out of reach. The Bulls (22 - 23) really needed this one, as they were coming off two ugly losses. Wade had a rough start to the game but ended up coming through, with a team - high 30 points, to go along with six rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals. Three other players scored in double digits for the Bulls, led by Jimmy Butler's 23 points. Paul Zipser came up big for Chicago, as he chipped in 13 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting, in 23 minutes off the bench, while Nikola Mirotic added 11 points off the bench. The Bulls will look to build on this win, as they head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Kings (18 - 27) were dealt a heartbreaker, as the foul on Wade's would - be go - ahead dunk was a questionable one, and will likely be mentioned in Sunday's L2M report. DeMarcus Cousins did all he could to give his team the edge, as he was the only player to score in double digits for the Kings. Cousins finished with a game - high 42 points, to go along with 14 rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal, in 35 minutes.

Wade missed the first of two free throws but hit the second to put his squad up 100 - 99. The Kings then took a timeout with 14 seconds on the clock. Out of the timeout, they inbounded the ball to Cousins at the three - point line, and he proceeded to take it into the paint, but as he was backing down his defender, Wade swooped in for the game saving steal, and raced away, passing the ball ahead for a dunk which put the game out of reach. The Bulls (22 - 23) really needed this one, as they were coming off two ugly losses. Wade had a rough start to the game but ended up coming through, with a team - high 30 points, to go along with six rebounds, four assists, four blocks and three steals. Three other players scored in double digits for the Bulls, led by Jimmy Butler's 23 points. Paul Zipser came up big for Chicago, as he chipped in 13 points on 4 - of - 8 shooting, in 23 minutes off the bench, while Nikola Mirotic added 11 points off the bench. The Bulls will look to build on this win, as they head to Orlando to take on the Magic on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Kings (18 - 27) were dealt a heartbreaker, as the foul on Wade's would - be go - ahead dunk was a questionable one, and will likely be mentioned in Sunday's L2M report. DeMarcus Cousins did all he could to give his team the edge, as he was the only player to score in double digits for the Kings. Cousins finished with a game - high 42 points, to go along with 14 rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal, in 35 minutes. The Kings will have to put the past behind them as they move on to Detroit, where they will face the third game of their current eight - game road trip.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Jazz's Points in 2nd quarter?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Atlanta was in desperate need of a win and they were able to take care of a shorthanded Miami team here. Defense was key for the Hawks, as they held the Heat to 42 percent shooting and forced them to commit 16 turnovers. Atlanta also dominated in the paint, winning the rebounding battle, 47 - 34, and outscoring them in the paint 58 - 26.The Hawks shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 27 of their 43 made baskets. This was a near wire - to - wire win for the Hawks, as Miami held just one lead in the first five minutes. Miami (7 - 15) are as beat - up as anyone right now and it's taking a toll on the heavily used starters. Hassan Whiteside really struggled in this game, as he amassed eight points, 12 rebounds and one blocks on 4 - of - 12 shooting. Tyler Johnson was the team's best player, as he tallied 27 points and five assists off the bench. Goran Dragic continued his good form, scoring 21 points and handing out four assists. Rodney McGruder got the start for Justise Winslow and finished with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists. It does n't get any easier for the Heat, as they play the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road for their next game. Atlanta (11 - 12) had lost seven - straight headed into this game, so to say this win was needed would be a drastic understatement. Dwight Howard took a lot of the load on his broad shoulders, as he tallied 23 points, 17 rebounds and four assists. It was n't just offense though, as he held the dominant Hassan Whiteside in check. Paul Millsap also played great, accumulating 21 points, nine rebounds, four steals and three blocks in the victory. Dennis Schroeder was the only other player in double figures, accruing 17 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Atlanta will look to build off this win on Friday, when they play the Milwaukee Bucks on the road.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of Home team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

Atlanta was in desperate need of a win and they were able to take care of a shorthanded Miami team here. Defense was key for the Hawks, as they held the Heat to 42 percent shooting and forced them to commit 16 turnovers. Atlanta also dominated in the paint, winning the rebounding battle, 47 - 34, and outscoring them in the paint 58 - 26.The Hawks shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 27 of their 43 made baskets. This was a near wire - to - wire win for the Hawks, as Miami held just one lead in the first five minutes. Miami (7 - 15) are as beat - up as anyone right now and it's taking a toll on the heavily used starters. Hassan Whiteside really struggled in this game, as he amassed eight points, 12 rebounds and one blocks on 4 - of - 12 shooting. Tyler Johnson was the team's best player, as he tallied 27 points and five assists off the bench. Goran Dragic continued his good form, scoring 21 points and handing out four assists. Rodney McGruder got the start for Justise Winslow and finished with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists. It does n't get any easier for the Heat, as they play the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road for their next game. Atlanta (11 - 12) had lost seven - straight headed into this game, so to say this win was needed would be a drastic understatement. Dwight Howard took a lot of the load on his broad shoulders, as he tallied 23 points, 17 rebounds and four assists. It was n't just offense though, as he held the dominant Hassan Whiteside in check. Paul Millsap also played great, accumulating 21 points, nine rebounds, four steals and three blocks in the victory. Dennis Schroeder was the only other player in double figures, accruing 17 points, four rebounds and seven assists.

Atlanta was in desperate need of a win and they were able to take care of a shorthanded Miami team here. Defense was key for the Hawks, as they held the Heat to 42 percent shooting and forced them to commit 16 turnovers. Atlanta also dominated in the paint, winning the rebounding battle, 47 - 34, and outscoring them in the paint 58 - 26.The Hawks shot 49 percent from the field and assisted on 27 of their 43 made baskets. This was a near wire - to - wire win for the Hawks, as Miami held just one lead in the first five minutes. Miami (7 - 15) are as beat - up as anyone right now and it's taking a toll on the heavily used starters. Hassan Whiteside really struggled in this game, as he amassed eight points, 12 rebounds and one blocks on 4 - of - 12 shooting. Tyler Johnson was the team's best player, as he tallied 27 points and five assists off the bench. Goran Dragic continued his good form, scoring 21 points and handing out four assists. Rodney McGruder got the start for Justise Winslow and finished with 11 points, five rebounds and five assists. It does n't get any easier for the Heat, as they play the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road for their next game. Atlanta (11 - 12) had lost seven - straight headed into this game, so to say this win was needed would be a drastic understatement. Dwight Howard took a lot of the load on his broad shoulders, as he tallied 23 points, 17 rebounds and four assists. It was n't just offense though, as he held the dominant Hassan Whiteside in check. Paul Millsap also played great, accumulating 21 points, nine rebounds, four steals and three blocks in the victory. Dennis Schroeder was the only other player in double figures, accruing 17 points, four rebounds and seven assists. Atlanta will look to build off this win on Friday, when they play the Milwaukee Bucks on the road.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Jazz's Wins?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Horford finished with 14 points and 12 boards, while Jeff Teague added 17 points and nine assists. DeMarre Carroll chipped in 13 points, and Schroder had 13 of his own off the bench.

Atlanta fell behind 30 - 23 after the first 12 minutes but responded with a big second quarter, outscoring Oklahoma City 25 - 17. The Hawks carried a four - point lead into the fourth quarter, when they would break the game open behind an 80 run spurred by Dennis Schroder. Schroder scored six points and assisted on an Al Horford layup, as the run put Atlanta up 87 - 76 with eight minutes to play. The Thunder never got within eight points the rest of the way, and a Horford three - pointer with two minutes to play put the exclamation point on a signature win for the East-leading Hawks. Atlanta, which shot 48 percent from the field, was led by 22 points and 10 rebounds from Paul Millsap. Horford finished with 14 points and 12 boards, while Jeff Teague added 17 points and nine assists. DeMarre Carroll chipped in 13 points, and Schroder had 13 of his own off the bench. The Hawks registered 27 assists as a team and out - rebounded the Thunder, who lead the NBA in rebounds per game, by an 11 - board margin. Oklahoma City got 22 points from Russell Westbrook and 21 from Kevin Durant, but only one other player, Serge Ibaka, scored in double - figures (13). The Thunder committed just 11 turnovers and connected on 10 three - pointers, but it was their interior defense that ultimately led to the loss. The Hawks scored more than half of their points in the paint (54) and shot 52 percent from two - point range. Up next, the Thunder head to Cleveland to take on the Cavaliers on Sunday afternoon.

Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: Home team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: The Chicago Bulls (2 - 1) took down the Cleveland Cavaliers (1 - 2) 99 - 96, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals on Friday. Derrick Rose hit a wild, three - point buzzer - beater that banked in for the win. That final bucket put Rose at 30 points for the evening to go along with his seven assists and seven rebounds. Pau Gasol injured his hamstring and was n't able to return after playing just 22 minutes. That made the impact of Nikola's Mirotic even more imperative, as the rookie showed he can be a big - game player. Mirotic had 12 points, eight rebounds and two steals in 22 minutes of action, as well as a plus - 19 in the plus/minus statistic, which was the highest of any player on either team. Regardless of his play, the Bulls would love to see Gasol back and healthy for Game 4 in Chicago on Sunday. The Cavaliers thought they were going to overtime, after J.R. Smith nailed a three - pointer with under eleven seconds to play. All they needed was one more stop, but Derrick Rose banked in his miraculous shot to end the Cavs hopes of an extra period. Kyrie Irving seemed to injure his foot in the first quarter and did n't quite look the same the rest of the way. He finished with just 11 points, four rebounds and two steals. Irving also failed to record an assists in 38 minutes. With Irving somewhat hobbled, it was up to LeBron James to take over for Cleveland. James finished with 27 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds but also recorded seven costly turnovers, with the Bulls' Jimmy Butler playing tenacious defense. Tristan Thompson had a nice game with 10 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks, but it was n't enough to regain homecourt advantage for the Cavaliers. If they cane win Game 4 in Chicago on Sunday, they'll head back home with two of the final three games being held in Cleveland.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of Home team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

Derrick Rose hit a wild, three - point buzzer - beater that banked in for the win. That final bucket put Rose at 30 points for the evening to go along with his seven assists and seven rebounds. Pau Gasol injured his hamstring and was n't able to return after playing just 22 minutes. That made the impact of Nikola's Mirotic even more imperative, as the rookie showed he can be a big - game player. Mirotic had 12 points, eight rebounds and two steals in 22 minutes of action, as well as a plus - 19 in the plus/minus statistic, which was the highest of any player on either team. Regardless of his play, the Bulls would love to see Gasol back and healthy for Game 4 in Chicago on Sunday. The Cavaliers thought they were going to overtime, after J.R. Smith nailed a three - pointer with under eleven seconds to play. All they needed was one more stop, but Derrick Rose banked in his miraculous shot to end the Cavs hopes of an extra period. Kyrie Irving seemed to injure his foot in the first quarter and did n't quite look the same the rest of the way. He finished with just 11 points, four rebounds and two steals. Irving also failed to record an assists in 38 minutes. With Irving somewhat hobbled, it was up to LeBron James to take over for Cleveland. James finished with 27 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds but also recorded seven costly turnovers, with the Bulls' Jimmy Butler playing tenacious defense. Tristan Thompson had a nice game with 10 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks, but it was n't enough to regain homecourt advantage for the Cavaliers.

The Hawks came out firing in this game and built an early lead, out - scoring the Bucks 48 - 35 in the first half alone. The Bucks made a run in the third to bring themselves within two, but the Hawks took off in the fourth quarter and finished with an 11 - point victory on the road. With the win, the Hawks ended the Bucks' four game winstreak, while also getting back in the winning column after losing their last two in a row. It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10 - 21FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks' frontcourt just did n't have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday's matchup. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4 - 11 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 17 points on the season, so he's still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7 - for - 15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3 - 13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he did n't grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals. It was his second straight start with Michael Carter-Williams still injured, as he's combined for 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists over that span, while posing as the replacement point guard in the starting lineup. As soon as Carter-Williams is healthy, it should push Bayless back to the bench.

The Hawks came out firing in this game and built an early lead, out - scoring the Bucks 48 - 35 in the first half alone. The Bucks made a run in the third to bring themselves within two, but the Hawks took off in the fourth quarter and finished with an 11 - point victory on the road. With the win, the Hawks ended the Bucks' four game winstreak, while also getting back in the winning column after losing their last two in a row. It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10 - 21FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks' frontcourt just did n't have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday's matchup. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4 - 11 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 17 points on the season, so he's still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7 - for - 15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3 - 13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he did n't grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals. It was his second straight start with Michael Carter-Williams still injured, as he's combined for 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists over that span, while posing as the replacement point guard in the starting lineup. As soon as Carter-Williams is healthy, it should push Bayless back to the bench. The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Monday.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Clippers's Losses?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Hawks came out firing in this game and built an early lead, out - scoring the Bucks 48 - 35 in the first half alone. The Bucks made a run in the third to bring themselves within two, but the Hawks took off in the fourth quarter and finished with an 11 - point victory on the road. With the win, the Hawks ended the Bucks' four game winstreak, while also getting back in the winning column after losing their last two in a row. It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10 - 21FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks' frontcourt just did n't have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday's matchup. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4 - 11 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 17 points on the season, so he's still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7 - for - 15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3 - 13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he did n't grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals.

It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10 - 21FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks' frontcourt just did n't have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday's matchup. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4 - 11 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 17 points on the season, so he's still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7 - for - 15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3 - 13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he did n't grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals. It was his second straight start with Michael Carter-Williams still injured, as he's combined for 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists over that span, while posing as the replacement point guard in the starting lineup. As soon as Carter-Williams is healthy, it should push Bayless back to the bench. The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Monday.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Jazz's Percentage of 3 points?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Hawks came out firing in this game and built an early lead, out - scoring the Bucks 48 - 35 in the first half alone. The Bucks made a run in the third to bring themselves within two, but the Hawks took off in the fourth quarter and finished with an 11 - point victory on the road. With the win, the Hawks ended the Bucks' four game winstreak, while also getting back in the winning column after losing their last two in a row. It was a relatively sloppy game, with each team committing at least 20 turnovers, but the Hawks were able to overcome and keep themselves positioned atop the Eastern Conference standings. The Hawks had six players reach double figures, including all five starters. Paul Millsap was especially effective, as he went off for 23 points (10 - 21FG, 1 - 3 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT), 16 rebounds and two blocked shots. The Bucks' frontcourt just did n't have an answer for him defensively, as Millsap got all the shots he wanted, all game long. Center Al Horford also had an impressive showing, posting 15 points (5 - 12 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 5 - 6 FT), eight rebounds and two blocked shots. He struggled offensively in his first game back from the All-Star break with only seven points on Friday, so it looked as if Horford was back to his normal ways in Sunday's matchup. The Hawks' backcourt duo of Kyle Korver (4 - 11 FG, 4 - 9 3Pt) and Jeff Teague (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 FT) also reached double figures with 12 and 10 points respectively. Teague has scored 12 points or less in each of his last four games, despite averaging 17 points on the season, so he's still trying to get things turned back around. Dennis Schroder added 12 points (3 - 10 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) and nine assists off the bench in 26 minutes. Giannis Antetokounmpo had a strong showing in this one, going 7 - for - 15 from the field to score 19 points, while also adding four rebounds and two blocked shots. After shooting just 23 percent (3 - 13 FG) from the field on Friday, it was good to see him get back on track, although he did n't grab as many rebounds as he normally does. Khris Middleton added 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 6 - 6 FT) of his own, to go along with four rebounds and five assists. He's had a nice stretch of four games, averaging 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists over that span, so he showed no signs of slowing down Sunday. Receiving another start at point guard, Jarryd Bayless went 6 - for - 11 from the field and 1 - for - 2 from the three - point line to finish with 13 points, while adding three assists and three steals. It was his second straight start with Michael Carter-Williams still injured, as he's combined for 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists over that span, while posing as the replacement point guard in the starting lineup. As soon as Carter-Williams is healthy, it should push Bayless back to the bench. The Hawks' next game will be at home against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, while the Bucks will travel to Chicago to play the Bulls on Monday.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Jazz's Points in 3rd quarter?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Detroit's Jodie Meeks stole the show by putting on a three - point clinic, shooting 9 - of - 11 from deep on his way to scoring a season - high 34 points. Meeks began taking over in the second quarter, where he scored 11 consecutive points for the Pistons to help them take a nine - point lead late in the first half. He received from help from starting center Andre Drummond. Drummond put up a double - double of 17 points and 22 rebounds in 31 minutes. The Pistons have now won their last three games by a combined 56 points, which is all the more impressive considering that they had lost four in a row prior to this current win streak. Detroit will look to extend its winning streak on Friday when they travel to Madison Square Garden to take on the Knicks. The Magic were playing their second game in as many days, coming off a win over the Miami Heat on Monday. They entered the fourth quarter down by just ten points, but mustered only three points in the first four minutes of the period while Detroit extended its lead to 19 points. The Magic will play another back - to - back set this weekend when they host the Nets and Hornets on Friday and Saturday respectively.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of Home team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

Portland actually led for the majority of the game, as Detroit outscored them by 11 in the fourth quarter and overtime. Turnovers were the glaring difference in the game, as the Pistons committed just seven turnovers, while forcing 24 from the Trail Blazers. Portland dominated the shooting strangely enough, as they shot 52 percent to Detroit's 43 percent.

Damian Lillard did all he could for Portland, as he led the team with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. C.J. McCollum tallied 25 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jusuf Nurkic continued his good form with Portland, as he accrued 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Those three did combine for 14 turnovers though, which was double the total of the Pistons. Portland will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday for their next game. The Pistons (29 - 31) are slowly climbing back to .500, as they've now won three of their last four games.

There was n't a whole lot to separate these two in this matchup, as it took free basketball to decide a winner. Portland actually led for the majority of the game, as Detroit outscored them by 11 in the fourth quarter and overtime. Turnovers were the glaring difference in the game, as the Pistons committed just seven turnovers, while forcing 24 from the Trail Blazers. Portland dominated the shooting strangely enough, as they shot 52 percent to Detroit's 43 percent. The Blazers (23 - 35) are battling for the eight - seed in the west and overtime losses like this are devastating for that pursuit. Damian Lillard did all he could for Portland, as he led the team with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. C.J. McCollum tallied 25 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jusuf Nurkic continued his good form with Portland, as he accrued 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Those three did combine for 14 turnovers though, which was double the total of the Pistons. Portland will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday for their next game. The Pistons (29 - 31) are slowly climbing back to .500, as they've now won three of their last four games. Marcus Morris was the player of the game, as he accumulated 37 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Andre Drummond finished second on the team, totaling 19 points and 15 rebounds.

The Blazers (23 - 35) are battling for the eight - seed in the west and overtime losses like this are devastating for that pursuit. Damian Lillard did all he could for Portland, as he led the team with 34 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. C.J. McCollum tallied 25 points, four rebounds and two assists. Jusuf Nurkic continued his good form with Portland, as he accrued 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists. Those three did combine for 14 turnovers though, which was double the total of the Pistons. Portland will host the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday for their next game. The Pistons (29 - 31) are slowly climbing back to .500, as they've now won three of their last four games. Marcus Morris was the player of the game, as he accumulated 37 points, eight rebounds and six assists. Andre Drummond finished second on the team, totaling 19 points and 15 rebounds. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope collected 16 points, three rebounds, three assists and three steals. Ish Smith was a huge spark off the bench, providing 12 points, seven assists and seven steals.

Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

The Nets shot a cool 47 percent (9 - 19) from three as a team. Gallinari's 24 was a game - high as he sank four three - pointers; he also dished seven assists, grabbed three rebounds and nabbed two steals. Kenneth Faried scored 22 and added 13 rebounds for his third double - double in the past four games.

He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday.

Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

After holding just a two point lead after the first half, the Bucks used a monster second half to turn this game into a route, outscoring the Nets by 12 in the third period and nine in the fourth. The victory not only brought Milwaukee back to .500, but it also clinched them a playoff birth after holding the worst record in the NBA last season. Ersan Ilyasova led the way for the Bucks, scoring 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), 11 of which came in the third quarter, and grabbing five rebounds in 28 minutes. This comes after Ilyasova scored just eight points in his previous two outings combined. Khris Middleton scored 16 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to along with seven assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes of action. Giannis Antetokounmpo was not far behind, recording 13 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting, nine rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes. O.J. Mayo scored 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) in 20 minutes off the bench, while Michael Carter-Williams scored 12 to round out the five Milwaukee players who scored in double figures. The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end. The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half - game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule. Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double - double of 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. Off the bench, both Mason Plumlee and Jarrett Jack scored 11 points in 17 and 24 minutes respectively. Deron Williams struggled mightily shooting the ball, going just 1 - for - 11 from the field en route to scoring just four points in 33 minutes. He was, however, able to record seven assists and seven rebounds. As a team, the Nets shot a dreadful 33 percent from the field and 17 percent from three, all while recording 21 turnovers to just 17 assists.

The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end. The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half - game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule. Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double - double of 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes.

Ersan Ilyasova led the way for the Bucks, scoring 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), 11 of which came in the third quarter, and grabbing five rebounds in 28 minutes. This comes after Ilyasova scored just eight points in his previous two outings combined. Khris Middleton scored 16 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to along with seven assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes of action. Giannis Antetokounmpo was not far behind, recording 13 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting, nine rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes. O.J. Mayo scored 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) in 20 minutes off the bench, while Michael Carter-Williams scored 12 to round out the five Milwaukee players who scored in double figures. The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end. The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half - game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule. Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double - double of 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. Off the bench, both Mason Plumlee and Jarrett Jack scored 11 points in 17 and 24 minutes respectively. Deron Williams struggled mightily shooting the ball, going just 1 - for - 11 from the field en route to scoring just four points in 33 minutes. He was, however, able to record seven assists and seven rebounds. As a team, the Nets shot a dreadful 33 percent from the field and 17 percent from three, all while recording 21 turnovers to just 17 assists. Up next, the Bucks will travel to Philadelphia Monday to take on the 76ers, while the Nets head home to Chicago Monday to play the Bulls with their playoff hopes in the balance.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Clippers's Rebounds?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

After holding just a two point lead after the first half, the Bucks used a monster second half to turn this game into a route, outscoring the Nets by 12 in the third period and nine in the fourth. The victory not only brought Milwaukee back to .500, but it also clinched them a playoff birth after holding the worst record in the NBA last season. Ersan Ilyasova led the way for the Bucks, scoring 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), 11 of which came in the third quarter, and grabbing five rebounds in 28 minutes. This comes after Ilyasova scored just eight points in his previous two outings combined.

The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end. The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half - game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule. Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double - double of 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes.

Deron Williams struggled mightily shooting the ball, going just 1 - for - 11 from the field en route to scoring just four points in 33 minutes.

After holding just a two point lead after the first half, the Bucks used a monster second half to turn this game into a route, outscoring the Nets by 12 in the third period and nine in the fourth. The victory not only brought Milwaukee back to .500, but it also clinched them a playoff birth after holding the worst record in the NBA last season. Ersan Ilyasova led the way for the Bucks, scoring 21 points (8 - 12 FG, 3 - 6 3Pt), 11 of which came in the third quarter, and grabbing five rebounds in 28 minutes. This comes after Ilyasova scored just eight points in his previous two outings combined. Khris Middleton scored 16 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to along with seven assists and four rebounds in 30 minutes of action. Giannis Antetokounmpo was not far behind, recording 13 points on 6 - of - 14 shooting, nine rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes. O.J. Mayo scored 17 points (6 - 13 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt) in 20 minutes off the bench, while Michael Carter-Williams scored 12 to round out the five Milwaukee players who scored in double figures. The Bucks recorded 30 total assists on 41 made field goals, and the win leaves them as the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference, which is likely where they will stay as the season comes to an end. The loss is a big one for the Nets, as they are still fighting for their playoff lives, and this loss leaves them with just a half - game lead over the Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with two games left on their schedule. Only one Brooklyn starter scored in double figures, as Brook Lopez recorded a double - double of 12 points (3 - 8 FG, 6 - 7 FT) and 10 rebounds in 31 minutes. Off the bench, both Mason Plumlee and Jarrett Jack scored 11 points in 17 and 24 minutes respectively. Deron Williams struggled mightily shooting the ball, going just 1 - for - 11 from the field en route to scoring just four points in 33 minutes. He was, however, able to record seven assists and seven rebounds.

This game was nearly over before fans could settle into their seats as the Spurs jumped out to a 29 - 10 lead after one quarter. The rout was on from there as the Thunder failed to get into a rhythm on offense and simply could n't get stops to cut into the lead. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook was held in check, finishing with 17 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 26 minutes before being rested for the fourth quarter. San Antonio has now won eight games in a row and are putting pressure on the teams ahead of it in the Western Conference playoff standings. San Antonio has beaten the likes of Golden State, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City (twice) during its current win streak. Kawhi Leonard led the charge for the Spurs, scoring 26 points in 24 minutes on the floor. The lone blemish for the Spurs in Tuesday's game was Tony Parker, who missed of the second half with tightness in his Achilles. The Spurs could have just been exercising caution with their veteran guard as they held a 26 - point lead at halftime and have another Game Wednesday against Houston. Oklahoma City once seemed to be a near lock for the eighth seed in the West, but a four - game slide has sent the Thunder tumbling out of the playoff standings. The Pelicans got the win Tuesday and are now in the driver's seat for the last playoff spot. Oklahoma City is at a disadvantage down the stretch because New Orleans holds the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Thunder. On the injury front, Andre Roberson returned to action after missing two and a half weeks with an ankle injury. He finished with five points and two steals in 18 minutes of action.

This game was nearly over before fans could settle into their seats as the Spurs jumped out to a 29 - 10 lead after one quarter. The rout was on from there as the Thunder failed to get into a rhythm on offense and simply could n't get stops to cut into the lead. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook was held in check, finishing with 17 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 26 minutes before being rested for the fourth quarter. San Antonio has now won eight games in a row and are putting pressure on the teams ahead of it in the Western Conference playoff standings. San Antonio has beaten the likes of Golden State, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City (twice) during its current win streak. Kawhi Leonard led the charge for the Spurs, scoring 26 points in 24 minutes on the floor. The lone blemish for the Spurs in Tuesday's game was Tony Parker, who missed of the second half with tightness in his Achilles. The Spurs could have just been exercising caution with their veteran guard as they held a 26 - point lead at halftime and have another Game Wednesday against Houston. Oklahoma City once seemed to be a near lock for the eighth seed in the West, but a four - game slide has sent the Thunder tumbling out of the playoff standings. The Pelicans got the win Tuesday and are now in the driver's seat for the last playoff spot. Oklahoma City is at a disadvantage down the stretch because New Orleans holds the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Thunder. On the injury front, Andre Roberson returned to action after missing two and a half weeks with an ankle injury. He finished with five points and two steals in 18 minutes of action.

Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday. Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: visiting team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: The San Antonio Spurs (52 - 26) continued their torrid stretch Tuesday with a 113 - 88 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder (42 - 36) at the Chesapeake Energy Arena. This game was nearly over before fans could settle into their seats as the Spurs jumped out to a 29 - 10 lead after one quarter. The rout was on from there as the Thunder failed to get into a rhythm on offense and simply could n't get stops to cut into the lead. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook was held in check, finishing with 17 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 26 minutes before being rested for the fourth quarter. San Antonio has now won eight games in a row and are putting pressure on the teams ahead of it in the Western Conference playoff standings. San Antonio has beaten the likes of Golden State, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City (twice) during its current win streak. Kawhi Leonard led the charge for the Spurs, scoring 26 points in 24 minutes on the floor. The lone blemish for the Spurs in Tuesday's game was Tony Parker, who missed of the second half with tightness in his Achilles. The Spurs could have just been exercising caution with their veteran guard as they held a 26 - point lead at halftime and have another Game Wednesday against Houston. Oklahoma City once seemed to be a near lock for the eighth seed in the West, but a four - game slide has sent the Thunder tumbling out of the playoff standings. The Pelicans got the win Tuesday and are now in the driver's seat for the last playoff spot. Oklahoma City is at a disadvantage down the stretch because New Orleans holds the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Thunder. On the injury front, Andre Roberson returned to action after missing two and a half weeks with an ankle injury. He finished with five points and two steals in 18 minutes of action. The Thunder will look to snap their losing streak Friday when they host the Kings.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of visiting team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

This game was nearly over before fans could settle into their seats as the Spurs jumped out to a 29 - 10 lead after one quarter. The rout was on from there as the Thunder failed to get into a rhythm on offense and simply could n't get stops to cut into the lead. Oklahoma City's Russell Westbrook was held in check, finishing with 17 points, two rebounds, and two assists in 26 minutes before being rested for the fourth quarter. San Antonio has now won eight games in a row and are putting pressure on the teams ahead of it in the Western Conference playoff standings. San Antonio has beaten the likes of Golden State, Memphis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City (twice) during its current win streak. Kawhi Leonard led the charge for the Spurs, scoring 26 points in 24 minutes on the floor. The lone blemish for the Spurs in Tuesday's game was Tony Parker, who missed of the second half with tightness in his Achilles. The Spurs could have just been exercising caution with their veteran guard as they held a 26 - point lead at halftime and have another Game Wednesday against Houston. Oklahoma City once seemed to be a near lock for the eighth seed in the West, but a four - game slide has sent the Thunder tumbling out of the playoff standings. The Pelicans got the win Tuesday and are now in the driver's seat for the last playoff spot. Oklahoma City is at a disadvantage down the stretch because New Orleans holds the head - to - head tiebreaker over the Thunder. On the injury front, Andre Roberson returned to action after missing two and a half weeks with an ankle injury. He finished with five points and two steals in 18 minutes of action.

This game was close in the early going, but Denver broke it open with a 41 point outburst in the second quarter to take a 69 - 51 lead into halftime. Denver's Danilo Gallinari exploded for 40 points, including going 6 - for - 13 from beyond the arc as the Nuggets cruised to their 27th victory of the season. Orlando's Elfrid Payton had his triple - double streak halted at two games with a 6 point, eight rebound, and eight assist outing. With Sunday's win, Denver swept the season series over Orlando. Denver had lost three straight on its five game road trip, but was able to salvage a 2 - 3 mark on the swing with Sunday's convincing victory. Jameer Nelson was a question mark coming into this game as he was dealing with a hip injury, but was able to log 17 minutes on the floor and finish with 15 points and five assists against his former club. The Nuggets will return home to face the 76ers on Wednesday. Orlando came into this game on the heels of Friday's 111 - 104 victory over Portland that was arguably its best of the season. The Magic were unable to put together a good defensive effort and were blown out on their home court against a struggling Nuggets club. Andrew Nicholson was thrust into the starting lineup with Channing Frye sidelined and performed ably, finishing with 13 points and six rebounds. Tobias Harris missed his third straight game Sunday as he continues to deal with an ailing ankle, but he is close to a return.

Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: visiting team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: Following a week filled with trade rumors, Paul George came out of the All-Star break in fairly unimpressive fashion.

He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

The game marked the return of Kyrie Irving to the court for the first time since suffering a fractured kneecap in last season's NBA Finals. The 23 - year - old gave Cavs fans and management plenty of reason for optimism, as he tallied 12 points, four assists, a rebound and two steals over a highly productive 17 minutes. Irving drained a pair of three - pointers as part of that effort, and looked crisp overall in his first game action. While they are sure to manage his minutes carefully in the first few games, an already formidable Cavs squad now stands to greatly benefit from the talent infusion that the All-Star point guard provides. The Sixers were led by Nerlens Noel's 15 points, which he impressively supplemented with 12 rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. The power forward was the sole Philadelphia starter with double - digit scoring, as reserves T.J. McConnell and Jakarr Sampson were the only other teammates to join him in that distinction with a pair of 10 - point efforts. Rookie standout Jahlil Okafor struggled against the one of the stingiest defenses in the NBA versus opposing centers, netting only nine points and eight rebounds. Robert Covington and Isaiah Canaan each struggled through a pair of 2 for 9 shooting performances from the field, and the Sixers shot a forgettable 35 percent as a team. Philadelphia fell to 1 - 28 and sports the worst record in the NBA. They currently reside in last place in the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division, and head home to face the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday. The comfortable lead the Cavs held in the second half allowed them the luxury of sitting LeBron James for the entire fourth quarter. He filled out the stat sheet through three periods anyhow, collecting 23 points, five rebounds, four assists, three steals and a block over just 25 minutes. Kevin Love joined Irving and James in double - digit scoring with 10 points, and the Cavs power forward added four rebounds, an assist and a steal over a scant 22 minutes. Timofey Mozgov's eight - point, eight - rebound performance rounded out an efficient afternoon for the starters, and Matthew Delladedova was outstanding off the bench in relief of Irving with 20 points, two assists, two steals and two blocks.

Star center Nikola Jokic (hip) and point guard Emmanuel Mudiay (hamstring) both missed the contest. Jokic's absence meant no shortage of rebounds for forward Kenneth Faried, who gobbled up 17 boards to lead the team.

For the Lakers (16 - 34), three players scored at least 20 points en route to the high - offense win. Most notably, sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell had one of his better games of the season, scoring 22 and dishing out 10 assists with only two turnovers. Russell was just one of the bevvy of Lakers guards who had a strong showing on Tuesday. Veteran Nick Young drained five three - pointers and scored a team - high 23 points. Off the bench, sixth man Lou Williams scored another 21 for the Lakers while dishing another seven assists. The Lakers were the beneficiaries of a cold Denver team, as the Nuggets shot just 41 percent and looked frozen in the third quarter. Denver (21 - 25), meanwhile, had some key absences on Tuesday. Star center Nikola Jokic (hip) and point guard Emmanuel Mudiay (hamstring) both missed the contest. Jokic's absence meant no shortage of rebounds for forward Kenneth Faried, who gobbled up 17 boards to lead the team. Thanks in large part to Faried's effort, the Nuggets established a 51 - 44 advantage on the offensive glass.

For the Lakers (16 - 34), three players scored at least 20 points en route to the high - offense win. Most notably, sophomore point guard D'Angelo Russell had one of his better games of the season, scoring 22 and dishing out 10 assists with only two turnovers. Russell was just one of the bevvy of Lakers guards who had a strong showing on Tuesday. Veteran Nick Young drained five three - pointers and scored a team - high 23 points. Off the bench, sixth man Lou Williams scored another 21 for the Lakers while dishing another seven assists. The Lakers were the beneficiaries of a cold Denver team, as the Nuggets shot just 41 percent and looked frozen in the third quarter. Denver (21 - 25), meanwhile, had some key absences on Tuesday. Star center Nikola Jokic (hip) and point guard Emmanuel Mudiay (hamstring) both missed the contest. Jokic's absence meant no shortage of rebounds for forward Kenneth Faried, who gobbled up 17 boards to lead the team. Thanks in large part to Faried's effort, the Nuggets established a 51 - 44 advantage on the offensive glass. With Jokic out, however, the Nuggets saw some lackluster offense, particularly during stretches in the second half. The team shot only 41 percent, despite knocking down 15 - of - 27 from beyond the three - point line. Denver will host the Grizzlies on Wednesday, while the Lakers will visit Washington on Thurdsay.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Clippers's Turnovers?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",
