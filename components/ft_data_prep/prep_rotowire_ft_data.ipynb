       "\"The Atlanta Hawks (46 - 12) beat the Orlando Magic (19 - 41) 95 - 88 on Friday. Al Horford had a good all - around game, putting up 17 points, 13 rebounds, four assists and two steals in a tough matchup against Nikola Vucevic. Kyle Korver was the lone Atlanta starter not to reach double figures in points. Jeff Teague bounced back from an illness, he scored 17 points to go along with seven assists and two steals. After a rough start to the month, the Hawks have won three straight and sit atop the Eastern Conference with a nine game lead on the second place Toronto Raptors. The Magic lost in devastating fashion to the Miami Heat in overtime Wednesday. They blew a seven point lead with 43 seconds remaining and they might have carried that with them into Friday's contest against the Hawks. Vucevic led the Magic with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Aaron Gordon (ankle) and Evan Fournier (hip) were unable to play due to injury. The Magic have four teams between them and the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Magic will host the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday, and the Hawks with take on the Heat in Miami on Saturday.\""

Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

The Bucks were able to have a great night defensively, giving themselves the scoring advantage in all four quarters. The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road. Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds.

He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R.

Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT).

Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT). The Bucks' next game will be at home against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday, while the Knicks will travel to Memphis to play the Grizzlies on Monday.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Knicks's Percentage of field goals?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Bucks were able to have a great night defensively, giving themselves the scoring advantage in all four quarters. The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road. Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT).

The Bucks were able to have a great night defensively, giving themselves the scoring advantage in all four quarters. The Bucks showed superior shooting, going 46 percent from the field, while the Knicks went only 41 percent from the floor. The Bucks also out - rebounded the Knicks 48 - 36, giving them in an even further advantage which helped them secure the 13 - point victory on the road. Brandon Knight led the Bucks again in this one. He went 6 - for - 14 from the field and 1 - for - 3 from beyond the arc to score 17 points, while also handing out five assists. He's now averaging 21 points per game over his last three games, as he's consistently been the offensive leader for this team. Zaza Pachulia also had a strong showing, finishing with 16 points (6 - 12 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and a team - high of 14 rebounds. It marked his second double - double in a row and fourth on the season, as the inexperienced centers on the Knicks' roster were n't able to limit him. Notching a double - double of his own, Giannis Antetokounmpo recorded 16 points (6 - 9 FG, 1 - 1 3Pt, 3 - 6 FT) and 12 rebounds. The 12 rebounds matched a season - high, while it was his second double - double of the season. Coming off the bench for a big night was Kendall Marshall. He went 6 - for - 8 from the field and 3 - for - 3 from the free throw line to score 15 points in 20 minutes. The Knicks really struggled to score without Carmelo Anthony and Amare Stoudemire. Tim Hardaway Jr led the team as the starting shooting guard, going 6 - for - 13 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 17 points, while also adding four assists. He's now scored 17 or more points in three out of his last four games, as he has put it on himself to pick up the slack with other key players sitting out. J.R. Smith also put together a solid outing as a starter. He finished with 15 points and seven rebounds in 37 minutes. Like Haradaway Jr, he's also benefitted from other guys sitting out, and has now combined for 37 points over his last two games. While he did n't have his best night defensively, Cole Aldrich scored 12 points (6 - 10 FG) and grabbed seven rebounds in 19 minutes. The only other Knick to reach double figures in points was Jason Smith, who came off the bench for 10 points (3 - 11 FG, 4 - 4 FT).

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals.

Despite being out - scored 31 - 25 in the final quarter, the Raptors were able to hold of the Pistons' late comeback attempt and secure the four - point victory in front of their home crowd. While the game may have been close, the Raptors shot the ball much better than the Pistons, going 53 percent from the field compared to just 46 percent from the field for the Pistons. The Raptors also forced them into 14 turnovers, while only committing eight of their own, which may have made a big difference in this one. After combining for only 14 points over his last three games, DeMar DeRozan returned to form Sunday, finishing with 25 points (8 - 14 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt, 8 - 10 FT), six rebounds and four assists. It was good to see him turn things around, as the Raptors really needed him to play well after losing six of their last ten games. Jonas Valnciunas was another big factor in the win. He went 9 - for - 15 from the field and 2 - for - 2 from the free throw line to score 20 points, while adding 11 rebounds and three blocked shots as well. He's now recorded a double - double in three out of his last four games, while also notching three blocks in two consecutive outings. Amir Johnson had a solid showing as well, finishing with an efficient 17 points (7 - 9 FG, 3 - 4 FT) and two rebounds. He only played 17 minutes in Friday's win over the Sixers, but he was back to a normal amount of minutes Sunday, playing a full game's worth of 28. Both Greivis Vasquez and Louis Williams reached double figures in points as well, with 13 and 12 points respectively. With Brandon Jennings going down for the year, D.J. Augustin stepped up in a big way, going 12 - for - 20 from the field and 5 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 35 points, while adding eight assists as well. It was the most shots he's taken all season, resulting in a new season - high in points. He'll run as the starting point guard moving forward. Greg Monroe had another strong stat line Sunday, recording 21 points (9 - 17 FG, 3 - 5 FT) and 16 rebounds. He's now posted a double - double in four out of his last five games. Andre Drummond nearly notched a double - double of his own, but came up just shy with 14 points (7 - 11 FG, 0 - 1 FT) and eight rebounds. He had a really tough matchup with Valanciunas, so he did n't have his normal eye - popping amount of rebounds that he's come accustomed to. The only other Piston to reach double figures in points was Kentavious Caldwell-Pope who added 16 points (6 - 17 FG, 3 - 9 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), three rebounds and two steals. The Raptors' next game will be on the road against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday, while the Pistons will be at home against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Pistons's Wins?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game.

Cleveland came out with purpose in the first half, wining both of the first two quarters to go into the break with 57 - 36 lead. Coach David Blatt could have taken the game easy with the Cavs up 30 in the series, but he opted to push the accelerator to the floor and used his big guns for most of the game to ensure a win and an end to the Cavs' first - round series. LeBron James played a team - high 46 minutes and was followed closely by Kyrie Irving with 43 minutes of his own. Kevin Love was forced from the game in the first quarter with what appeared to be a dislocated left shoulder after Celtics big man Kelly Olynyk appeared to pull down on Love's arm while fighting for a rebound. Love was n't the only player to be forced from the game, and the Love/Olynyk incident was n't the only physical altercation. In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors.

In the second quarter, Kendrick Perkins put a hard screen on Jae Crowder, pushing Crowder in his face and forcing him to the ground before antagonizing Crowder with a tap to the face with a closed fist. Both Perkins and Crowder were assessed technical fouls, and Perkins earned a flagrant - 1 foul for the tap to Crowder's face. Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Celtics's Rebounds?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Shortly after halftime, Crowder was hit in the face by a backhand from J.R. Smith. Smith was given a flagrant - 2 and automatically ejected from the game as a result. Crowder injured his knee during the Smith incident and left the game with a left knee sprain, unable to return. The Celtics made a run in the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 25 - 13 in the third window, but it was n't enough. Cleveland carried a nine - point lead into the fourth quarter and never let Boston get closer than a six - point divide at 99 - 93 with under a minute left in the game. The Cavaliers will advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals, and they'll play the winner of the Bulls/Bucks series that is currently at 3 - 1 with the Bulls holding the advantage. Kevin Love's status will be updated after he gets back to Cleveland and undergoes tests with the team's doctors. Smith and Perkins appear in line for suspensions, and a judgment on their statuses will likely be handed down before the start of the conference semifinals.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Cavaliers's Total points?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: visiting team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: The New York Knicks (28 - 40) defeated the Los Angeles Lakers (14 - 53) 90 - 87 on Sunday. The game was largely a tale of two halves, with New York dominating the first two quarters despite missing two starters on offense, and jumping out to a 46 - 35 lead by intermission. However, the Lakers battled back through the final two periods, and the two teams found themselves knotted at 87 with 29 seconds left. Neither club could find a way to break the tie over the ensuing 28 ticks of the clock, with Kobe Bryant failing to hit a 12 - foot jumper for the Lakers after a 19 - second possession. Carmelo Anthony hauled in the defensive rebound off the missed shot, and following a Knicks timeout, Jose Calderon sealed the victory with a clutch 26 - foot three - point jumper with less than a second remaining.

It was n't the cleanest game ever played, with the Timberwolves handing out 23 turnovers and the Grizzlies racking up 17 of their own, but it was still a tight matchup that ended with a close finish. Marc Gasol put the Grizzlies on his back and helped the Grizzlies get their first victory of the year. Gasol finished the game with 32 points (12 - 17 FG), nine rebounds, three assists, two steals, and two blocked shots, getting a little bit of everything on the stat sheet Wednesday. Not far behind was Zach Randolph, who had 25 points (12 - 16 FG), 13 rebounds, an assist, and a block.

Not far behind was Zach Randolph, who had 25 points (12 - 16 FG), 13 rebounds, an assist, and a block. Mike Conley also passed the double - digit benchmark and finished with 16 points to go along with one rebound, six assists, and a steal. The other starting guard, Courtney Lee, shot 5 - for - 11 from the field and 2 - for - 4 from behind the arc to score 14 points in 35 minutes of action. Despite the win, the Grizzlies got little output from their bench unit, who only scored 10 of their 105 total points. With a ton of fresh faces, this was finally a shot for Timberwolves' fans to see their new young lineup. Thaddeus Young was very efficient in his debut, scoring 26 points (10 - 18 FG, 2 - 3 3PT, 4 - 4 FT) and grabbing four rebounds, four assists, and two steals. Mo Williams matched Young's efficiency and added 18 points (6 - 9 FG, 2 - 3 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT) of his own. Williams also contributed four assists and a steal. No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins made his regular season debut but only had six points, three rebounds, an assist, and two steals, playing just 18 minutes.

Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game. The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz (36 - 37) on Monday, while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors (66 - 7).\\n    Question: What's the Team name of Home team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

Washington ended a short, but important two game losing skid with an easy victory on the road, and are now 3 games back of the Detroit Pistons for the 8 - seed in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards played at a high speed pace, led by John Wall, who diced through the Lakers defense and took advantage of his matchup with D’Angelo Russell. Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game.

Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game.

Wall’s 22 points, 13 assists and five rebounds overshadowed his seven turnovers, which proved to be a non - issue seeing the double digit lead his team held for most of the game. The former No. 1 overall pick ran impressive sets with Marcin Gortat, who was on the receiving end of multiple flashy dimes, and turned in 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers got into early foul trouble and ended up with a total of 26 team fouls, but the Wizards shot a poor 16 - of - 29 from the free throw line. Given the amount of times that Los Angeles put Washington on the line, the 13 points loss could well have been a 20 - plus point blowout. D’Angelo Russell was no match defending Wall from getting to the rim, but he did equal his opponents scoring with 22 points of his own. Kobe Bryant has a handful of games left in his career, and the wear and tear of his 20th season reared it’s head a few times during the game. Bryant finished with 17 points, one rebound and two assists on 6 - of - 15 shooting, but also looked sloppy handling the ball at times, which he even recognized after checking himself out of the game. The Lakers will visit the Utah Jazz (36 - 37) on Monday, while the Wizards will head north to take on the Golden State Warriors (66 - 7).\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Wizards's Rebounds?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists.

Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists.

In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists.

With 50 seconds left in the game, Kendrick Perkins was able to hit a jumper and put the Cavaliers up two. It was Dejuan Blair who came up big for the Wizards though, banking in a shot to tie the game with just over seven seconds left in the game. Matthew Dellavedova had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but he missed and it went to overtime. In overtime, the Cavaliers took control of the game and ended up winning a momentum builder for the playoffs. Both teams had locked up their playoff spots before this game, but we now know for sure who each will play. The Wizards will take on the Toronto Raptors in the first round, while the Cavaliers will play the Boston Celtics. With LeBron James being held out of the lineup and the usual starters getting very limited minutes, it was the bench that took over this game for the Cavaliers. Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova had the biggest games off the bench. Shumpert went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 3 - for - 5 from the three - point line to score 18 points, while also adding six rebounds and two steals. Dellavedova, on the other hand, went 6 - for - 11 from the floor and 4 - for - 5 from deep to score 18 points, to go along with 12 assists and two steals. The double - double was the first for Dellavedova on the year, while both his point and assist totals were season - highs as well. Tristan Thompson was the other bench player to reach double figures. In 21 minutes, he finished with 12 points (4 - 7 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and eight rebounds, boosting his April averages to 7 points and 8 rebounds per game over 23 minutes. Playing just 18 minutes with the starters, Kevin Love was still very efficient with his time and chipped in with 19 points (6 - 12 FG, 5 - 6 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and three rebounds before getting most of the night off for rest. Like the Cavaliers, the Wizards rested the majority of their players, as John Wall, Bradley Beal and Paul Pierce were all held out of this matchup. It was Martell Webster who had the biggest outing, as he came off the bench for 20 points (5 - 9 FG, 3 - 5 3Pt, 7 - 8 FT) and three rebounds over 36 minutes. The 20 points were a new season - high for the forward, as he had yet to break double figures in points during this season. Rasual Butler was another reason the Wizards were able to keep this game close. He finished with 17 points (7 - 19 FG, 3 - 8 3Pt), seven rebounds and two steals, while playing 45 minutes. It was a nice end to the season for Butler, who finishes the year with averages of 8 points and 3 rebounds over 74 games. Both Kevin Seraphin and Ramon Sessions reached double figures in points as well. Seraphin recorded 12 points (6 - 13 FG, 0 - 1 FT), 12 rebounds and three blocked shots, while Sessions added 14 points (4 - 8 FG, 2 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 6 FT) and six assists.

The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game.

The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that.

The game was a tale of two halves, as these teams showed why they have struggled so much this season. The Nuggets scored 64 points in the first half to take a 13 - point lead, but blew it in the second half with some bad defense. The Lakers outscored Denver 32 - 16 in the third quarter and went to Kobe Bryant to close things out at the end. Denver made some crucial errors late and it really hurt them in a game they really should have won. It was a vintage Kobe performance, as he carried the Lakers to a much needed win. He matched his season - high with 31 points and hit multiple baskets late to seal the victory. Jordan Clarkson and Lou Williams both played good as well, as they scored 36 points combined. The offense has been terrible all season, for the Lakers, but this 111 - spot will hopefully get them going. Their next game will be on Christmas, when they take on the Los Angeles Clippers. The Nuggets had a season - high 21 - point lead in the second quarter, but managed to choke that away. They let the Lakers go on a 23 - 3 run between the second and third quarter and could never recover after that. Will Barton scored 18 points in the first quarter, but really struggled after that, finishing with 25 in the game. The one bright spot was the bench, as all four players who came off the bench scored at least nine points while accumulating 58 points all together. Denver also played this game without Danilo Gallinari and that might have been the key in the loss with no go - to weapon at the end of the game.

Chris Paul recorded the NBA's first triple - double of the 2014 - 15 season, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists in 36 minutes. He also threw in two steals and a blocked shot for good measure. Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

The Mavericks outplayed the Grizzlies in several categories, yet curiously still came up well short of a victory. Dallas drained 11 three - pointers to Memphis’ seven, and the Mavs also outrebounded the home team 48 to 42. Zaza Pachulia’s performance particularly stood out in this regard, as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol. Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies’ big man, matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own, his second on the season. The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds, while adding a block and a steal. Deron Williams (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (11 points) made respectable contributions, with the latter draining three three - pointers, giving him seven over the last two contests. Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings. Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers, draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc. The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs. The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki. Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points, while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes. The Grizzlies improved to 8 - 7 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They head to Houston for a Wednesday showdown versus the Rockets.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of Home team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

The Mavericks outplayed the Grizzlies in several categories, yet curiously still came up well short of a victory. Dallas drained 11 three - pointers to Memphis’ seven, and the Mavs also outrebounded the home team 48 to 42. Zaza Pachulia’s performance particularly stood out in this regard, as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol. Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies’ big man, matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own, his second on the season. The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds, while adding a block and a steal. Deron Williams (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (11 points) made respectable contributions, with the latter draining three three - pointers, giving him seven over the last two contests. Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings. Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers, draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc. The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs. The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki. Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points, while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes.

Zaza Pachulia’s performance particularly stood out in this regard, as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol. Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies’ big man, matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own, his second on the season. The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds, while adding a block and a steal. Deron Williams (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (11 points) made respectable contributions, with the latter draining three three - pointers, giving him seven over the last two contests. Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings. Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers, draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc. The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs. The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki. Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points, while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes. The Grizzlies improved to 8 - 7 and currently reside in third place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division.

The Mavericks outplayed the Grizzlies in several categories, yet curiously still came up well short of a victory. Dallas drained 11 three - pointers to Memphis’ seven, and the Mavs also outrebounded the home team 48 to 42. Zaza Pachulia’s performance particularly stood out in this regard, as he held his own against one of the best all - around centers in the game in Marc Gasol. Pachulia went toe - to - toe on the glass with the Grizzlies’ big man, matching his 10 boards while also collecting 13 points. Veteran Dirk Nowitzki posted a double - double of his own, his second on the season. The veteran power forward totaled 14 points and 10 rebounds, while adding a block and a steal. Deron Williams (10 points) and Wesley Matthews (11 points) made respectable contributions, with the latter draining three three - pointers, giving him seven over the last two contests. Reserves J.J. Barea and Raymond Felton paced the Dallas bench with a pair of 16 - point outings. Felton was notably perfect on three - pointers, draining all four of his shots from beyond the arc. The Mavericks fell to 9 - 6 and currently reside in second place in the Western Conference’s Southwest Division. They travel to San Antonio for a Wednesday tilt versus the Spurs. The Grizzlies received a remarkably balanced offensive performance from their starters, something they have significantly lacked in many games this season. Gasol collected 15 points and the aforementioned 10 boards, while point guard Mike Conley continued his recent stretch of resurgent play on offense. The veteran tallied 21 points, six assists, and four rebounds, for his fourth game of 20 points or more in the last five contests. Matt Barnes parlayed his rare starting opportunity into a solid tally of 14 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of steals over 38 minutes. Jeff Green acquitted himself well filling in at power forward for the ailing Zach Randolph (knee), pitching in 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists and a pair of blocks in a tough matchup against Nowitzki. Mario Chalmers led the Memphis reserves with 14 points, while JaMychal Green made the most of his return to the bench by amassing 13 points over just 17 minutes.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes.

The Wizards have already dealt with the loss of an integral component for an extended stretch this season, and that experience is serving them well in the wake of the latest injury to a key cog of their team. Marcin Gortat is dealing with a series of knee complications that includes an infection, and has missed the last three games as a result. In his stead, Nene Hilario has stepped up with three solid performances, but multiple players elevated their respective games on the glass Friday to help make up for the big man's absence. The Wizards managed an outstanding 54 rebounds, including 37 on the defensive end. Meanwhile, Washington also shot a solid 52 percent from the field, and an equally impressive 44 percent from three - point range, leading to a relatively comfortable victory. John Wall spearheaded the Wizards' attack once again, posting a game - high 28 points and also tallying seven rebounds, eight assists and a steal. No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. DeJuan Blair and Gary Neal pitched in with a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter managing four boards and three assists.

John Wall spearheaded the Wizards' attack once again, posting a game - high 28 points and also tallying seven rebounds, eight assists and a steal. No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes.

Marcin Gortat is dealing with a series of knee complications that includes an infection, and has missed the last three games as a result. In his stead, Nene Hilario has stepped up with three solid performances, but multiple players elevated their respective games on the glass Friday to help make up for the big man's absence. The Wizards managed an outstanding 54 rebounds, including 37 on the defensive end. Meanwhile, Washington also shot a solid 52 percent from the field, and an equally impressive 44 percent from three - point range, leading to a relatively comfortable victory. John Wall spearheaded the Wizards' attack once again, posting a game - high 28 points and also tallying seven rebounds, eight assists and a steal. No other starter tallied double - digit scoring, but Hilario did match his eight points with eight boards, and added two assists, a steal and a block. Garrett Temple made another start in place of Beal, and contributed five points, six rebounds and five assists. However, Beal significantly outplayed him off the bench, posting 22 points, five rebounds and an assist over 22 minutes. DeJuan Blair and Gary Neal pitched in with a pair of 12 - point efforts, with the former adding six rebounds, an assist and a pair of steals, and the latter managing four boards and three assists. Ramon Sessions was the fourth reserve with a double - digit point total, stuffing the stat sheet over 23 minutes with 10 points, five assists, three rebounds and two steals.

What was expected to be a low - scoring contest turned into a back - and - forth showdown between the teams' two best offensive players. Kemba Walker was outstanding for Charlotte, amassing a career - high and franchise - record 52 points, while Utah's Gordon Hayward responded with 36 points of his own. While the spotlight largely and rightfully shone on that pair of remarkable efforts, Trey Burke also put together a notable performance while pacing the Jazz's bench, which included a 23 - foot three - point jumper with 13 seconds remaining in regulation that sent the game into its first extra period. Burke's key basket culiminated a 31 - 22 run by Utah in the fourth quarter to erase what had been a 73 - 64 deficit entering the period. After Rudy Gobert's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108, Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors. Hayward added nine assists, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz. Burke's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points, along with three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Gobert put together a second straight impressive double - double, tallying 14 points, hauling in 14 boards, dishing out three assists, and recording a steal and two blocks. Trevor Booker also made a significant contribution off the bench with 12 points, eight rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Utah fell to 18 - 23 and remains in second place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division. They head to New York to take on the Knicks on Wednesday. Walker almost added a triple - double to his spectacular afternoon, supplementing his eye - popping scoring numbers with nine rebounds and eight assists. He also threw in a pair of thefts. Marvin Williams was a distant second to him in scoring, but still turned in a solid effort with 19 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Cody Zeller managed 14 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block, while Nicolas Batum was a rebound short of a double - double with 10 points, nine boards, four assists and a steal. Rookie Frank Kaminsky III paced the Charlotte bench with 17 points, seven rebounds and a block. The Hornets improved to 19 - 22 but remain in last place in the Eastern Conference's Southeast Division.

Burke's key basket culiminated a 31 - 22 run by Utah in the fourth quarter to erase what had been a 73 - 64 deficit entering the period. After Rudy Gobert's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108, Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors. Hayward added nine assists, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz. Burke's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points, along with three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Gobert put together a second straight impressive double - double, tallying 14 points, hauling in 14 boards, dishing out three assists, and recording a steal and two blocks. Trevor Booker also made a significant contribution off the bench with 12 points, eight rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Utah fell to 18 - 23 and remains in second place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division. They head to New York to take on the Knicks on Wednesday. Walker almost added a triple - double to his spectacular afternoon, supplementing his eye - popping scoring numbers with nine rebounds and eight assists. He also threw in a pair of thefts. Marvin Williams was a distant second to him in scoring, but still turned in a solid effort with 19 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Cody Zeller managed 14 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block, while Nicolas Batum was a rebound short of a double - double with 10 points, nine boards, four assists and a steal.

What was expected to be a low - scoring contest turned into a back - and - forth showdown between the teams' two best offensive players. Kemba Walker was outstanding for Charlotte, amassing a career - high and franchise - record 52 points, while Utah's Gordon Hayward responded with 36 points of his own. While the spotlight largely and rightfully shone on that pair of remarkable efforts, Trey Burke also put together a notable performance while pacing the Jazz's bench, which included a 23 - foot three - point jumper with 13 seconds remaining in regulation that sent the game into its first extra period. Burke's key basket culiminated a 31 - 22 run by Utah in the fourth quarter to erase what had been a 73 - 64 deficit entering the period. After Rudy Gobert's dunk off a Hayward assist with seven seconds left in the first overtime tied things up at 108, Walker drained four free throws in the final minute of the sixth quarter to put a cap on what was a record - setting afternoon and send the Hornets to the locker room as weary victors. Hayward added nine assists, five rebounds, a pair of steals and a block to his team - high scoring total to pace the Jazz. Burke's memorable afternoon consisted of a season - high 25 points, along with three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Gobert put together a second straight impressive double - double, tallying 14 points, hauling in 14 boards, dishing out three assists, and recording a steal and two blocks. Trevor Booker also made a significant contribution off the bench with 12 points, eight rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block. Utah fell to 18 - 23 and remains in second place in the Western Conference's Northwest Division. They head to New York to take on the Knicks on Wednesday. Walker almost added a triple - double to his spectacular afternoon, supplementing his eye - popping scoring numbers with nine rebounds and eight assists. He also threw in a pair of thefts. Marvin Williams was a distant second to him in scoring, but still turned in a solid effort with 19 points, seven rebounds, an assist and a steal. Cody Zeller managed 14 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block, while Nicolas Batum was a rebound short of a double - double with 10 points, nine boards, four assists and a steal.

The 2015 Finals rematch featuring two of the very best in the NBA turned out to be more of a showcase for both teams' often underrated defenses. Neither squad was able to put on much of an offensive display, and the game had more of the feel of a grind - it - out Eastern Conference battle, rather than the free - wheeling, high - scoring affairs typically played by the reigning champs. The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA.

Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA.

Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA.

The Warriors shot 41 percent from the field and 28 percent from beyond the arc, with both numbers notably lower than their respective 49 and 42 season figures in those categories. Cleveland fared even worse, draining only 32 percent of their buckets overall, including a paltry 17 percent from long range. Both teams' point totals were also season - low tallies, underscoring how formidable both defensive units can be against top - tier competition. The Cavs were led by Lebron James' game - high 25 points, which he supplemented with nine rebounds, two assists, a steal and a pair of blocks. Despite the solid scoring total, the perennial All-Star was one of the superstars struggling with his shot, sinking only 10 of his 26 attempts. J.R. Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA. They remain home for a date with the Sacramento Kings on Monday.\\n    Question: What's the Team name of visiting team?\\n    Answer:\\n\\n\",\n",

Smith provided 14 points and did so largely on the strength of one of the game's only solid shooting performances from three - point range (4 of 8). Kyrie Irving continued his journey back from the fractured kneecap he suffered the last time he'd faced this Warriors squad in the 2015 Finals, playing a season - high 26 minutes and managing 13 points, three rebounds, two assists and a steal. Kevin Love helped spearhead Cleveland's outstanding team total of 55 rebounds on the evening by hauling in 18 boards, and pairing them with 10 points in his second straight double - double. Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavaliers' bench with 10 points over 31 minutes. Cleveland fell to 19 - 8 but remains in first place in the Eastern Conference's Central Division. The next stop on their West Coast road trip comes on Saturday in Portland, with a showdown with the Trail Blazers on tap. Golden State's offensive attack was paced by Draymond Green, who turned in another one of his trademark stat - sheet - stuffing performances. The 25 - year - old posted his fourth double - double in the last six contests with 22 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and a pair of blocks over 39 minutes. Green was one of the few players on either team to put together a solid shooting effort, managing a 47 percent success rate from the field, including draining two of his three attempts from three - point range. Stephen Curry followed up his season - low tally of 16 points against Utah on Wednesday by equaling his second - lowest total of 19 points on 6 of 15 shooting. However, the reigning MVP did add seven rebounds, seven assists and a pair of steals. The perpetually dependable Klay Thompson was exemplary once again in his typical supporting role, pitching in with 18 points, six rebounds, an assist and a block. Shaun Livingston was highly productive off the bench with a season - high 16 points, leading the Warriors' reserves. Golden State improved to 28 - 1 and continues to sport the best record in the Pacific Division, Western Conference and the entire NBA.

Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Visiting team\\nAnswer: Utah Jazz\\n\\nBelow is the usr's question:\\n    Role: visiting team\\n    Attribute: Team name\\n    Related Context: The Memphis Grizzlies (31 - 12) beat the Philadelphia 76ers (8 - 36), 101 - 83.

Teammate Blake Griffin helped Paul convert some of those assists, shooting 14 - of - 21 from the field and finishing with 31 points in 38 minutes. J.J. Redick started at shooting guard but played a season - low 16 minutes as coach Doc Rivers opted to go with Jamal Crawford most of the night. Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects. The Clippers' next game is against the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday, while the Jazz will return home to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday.\\nQuestion: What's is the Team Name of Home team\\nAnswer: Los Angeles Clippers\\n\\nRole: Visiting team\\nAttribute: Team Name\\nRelated Context: The Los Angeles Clippers (3 - 1) defeated the Utah Jazz (1 - 3) 107 - 101 on Monday.

All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins paved the way for Sacramento (6 - 9) to earn the easy win, scoring 36 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. Cousins' rebounding effort helped the team establish a 46 - 38 rebounding advantage against the normally tough Thunder. Kings guard Darren Collison added 21 points, but turned the ball over four times while dishing six assists. Cousins, Collison, and forward Rudy Gay each added three three - pointers, contributing to the 12 made by the team on the night. Sacramento reached a .500 record at home with the win. For the Thunder (8 - 8), things are continuing to get worse after the team started a surprising 5 - 1 to open the season. Point guard Russell Westbrook, however, has not seemed to slow down.

All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins paved the way for Sacramento (6 - 9) to earn the easy win, scoring 36 points and pulling down 13 rebounds. Cousins' rebounding effort helped the team establish a 46 - 38 rebounding advantage against the normally tough Thunder. Kings guard Darren Collison added 21 points, but turned the ball over four times while dishing six assists. Cousins, Collison, and forward Rudy Gay each added three three - pointers, contributing to the 12 made by the team on the night. Sacramento reached a .500 record at home with the win. For the Thunder (8 - 8), things are continuing to get worse after the team started a surprising 5 - 1 to open the season. Point guard Russell Westbrook, however, has not seemed to slow down. The NBA's leading scorer scored another 31 points on Wednesday, to go along with 11 rebounds and nine assists. Westbrook's numbers thus far have indicated that he may have a chance at being the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple - double in a season. The Thunder continued to struggle from deep in Tuesday's contest, shooting just 28 percent from beyond the arc. The team hit just seven triples in the contest. The thunder will travel to Denver on Friday, while the Kings will host the Houston Rockets.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Thunder's Wins?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes. Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points.

In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds.

The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes. Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points. After shooting just 25 percent (2 - 8 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday. In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season.

In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots.

With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds.

The Suns got out to a quick start in this one, grabbing a 25 - 18 lead right away after the first quarter. It remained pretty much even throughout the rest of the game, but the Suns were able to pull off a huge win, as it put them just two and a half games out of the final projected playoff seed in the Western Conference standings. The Suns were the superior shooters in this game, going 50 percent from the field and 25 percent from the three - point line, while the Timberwolves finished at just 44 percent from the floor and a disgraceful eight percent from beyond the arc. The Suns were led by Markieff Morris, who finished with a team - high of 24 points (10 - 15 FG, 0 - 2 3Pt, 4 - 4 FT), to go along with three rebounds and two assists in 37 minutes. It was a very nice bounce - back outing for the forward, as he posted just four points on 1 - of - 8 shooting from the field during Monday's game against the Warriors. He's now averaging 15 points and 6 rebounds on the year. Also getting a piece of the action was Eric Bledsoe, who had a great night shooting the ball to finish with 18 points (7 - 14 FG, 2 - 5 3Pt, 2 - 2 FT) and nine assists. It was his second strong showing in a row, as he's combined for 37 points and 12 assists over his last two games. The Suns gained even more of an advantage from their bench in the win, as they were extremely productive. Rookie T.J. Warren had a breakout performance and scored 17 points (8 - 10 FG, 0 - 1 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT) in just 19 minutes. The Suns drafted him knowing he could score at a high rate, so it's not surprising he was finally able to show a little more of what he's got. Marcus Thornton also reached double figures off the bench, with 14 points (6 - 12 FG, 1 - 5 3Pt, 1 - 1 FT) and four rebounds in 22 minutes. Kevin Martin did his best to keep the Timberwolves in this game. He went 5 - for - 8 from the field and 6 - for - 7 from the free throw line to score a team - high of 16 points. After shooting just 25 percent (2 - 8 FG) from the field in Monday's game against the Clippers, it was good to see him hit on such a high percentage of shots Wednesday. In a solid performance off the bench, Justin Hamilton went 7 - for - 12 from the field and 1 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score a season - high of 15 points, while also adding three rebounds and two blocked shots. It was a nice surprise for the Timberwolves, as he averages just 3 points per game and has reached double - digit points in just one other game this season. With Kevin Garnett sitting out on a night of rest, Adreian Payne moved back into the starting lineup for the fourth time this season. In 29 minutes, he finished with 10 points (3 - 9 FG, 4 - 4 FT) and three rebounds.

The Jazz jumped out to a 28 - 19 advantage after the first quarter and kept pouring it on throughout the contest, leading 50 - 33 at the break and outscoring the 76ers in the final two quarters as well. Though Utah shot just 41 percent from the field, they ran away with the game by winning the turnover battle by a huge margin, surrendering the ball just seven times to the Sixers’ 18 giveaways. Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points, respectively, while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks. The 76ers compounded their turnover problems by shooting even worse than Utah from the field, submitting a 30 percent mark as a team.

Rodney Hood and Alec Burks led the backcourt with 17 and 15 points, respectively, while Derrick Favors secured a double - double with 20 points and 12 boards to accompany three steals and two blocks.

The chief offender was star center Nerlens Noel, who accrued just eight points while going 2 - for - 12 from the field.

Crawford missed the Clippers' last game with a rib injury but returned to put up 19 points off the bench in 34 minutes. Gordon Hayward put up a LeBron James-esque line of 27 points, seven rebounds, and five assists in 36 minutes. He was aided in keeping the game close by starting power forward Enes Kanter who put up 17 points and nine rebounds in 27 minutes. The Jazz were relatively efficient with their shooting, but they committed 17 turnovers in contrast to the Clippers' 10, giving away the game in some respects.

DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay once again carried the load for the visitors, as they have been the Kings' top two scorers in every game they've both played this season. This was actually the first game that at least two other starters scored in double figures for the Kings for the entirety of the season. The Raptors stars really struggled shooting, as Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan combined to go 12 - of - 36 in the loss. The 23 - point outing from DeMar DeRozan was his lowest of the season, as he hadn’t scored below 32 points all year. With Jonas Valanciunas out of the lineup with a knee contusion, Toronto really struggled down low. In fact, they had no big man reach double figures in scoring or rebounding, while being outscored in the paint 52 - 30.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Kings's Wins?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Nets (15 - 56) came into Thursday on what could, by their standards, be considered a hot streak. They'd tallied five victories in 12 games in March but they were chasing a particularly significant win against the Suns (22 - 50). Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32 - 22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30 - 18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74 - 48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block.

Jeremy Lin tallied 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Archie Goodwin and Quincy Acy contributed matching 12 - point efforts as reserves. Isaiah Whitehead compiled 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block over 28 minutes. Justin Hamilton supplied 10 points and one rebound. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest five points but hauled in 16 boards, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and posted one block.

The Nets (15 - 56) came into Thursday on what could, by their standards, be considered a hot streak. They'd tallied five victories in 12 games in March but they were chasing a particularly significant win against the Suns (22 - 50). Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32 - 22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30 - 18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74 - 48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block.

Isaiah Whitehead compiled 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block over 28 minutes. Justin Hamilton supplied 10 points and one rebound. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest five points but hauled in 16 boards, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and posted one block.

The Nets (15 - 56) came into Thursday on what could, by their standards, be considered a hot streak. They'd tallied five victories in 12 games in March but they were chasing a particularly significant win against the Suns (22 - 50). Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32 - 22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30 - 18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74 - 48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block.

Jeremy Lin tallied 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Archie Goodwin and Quincy Acy contributed matching 12 - point efforts as reserves. Isaiah Whitehead compiled 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block over 28 minutes. Justin Hamilton supplied 10 points and one rebound. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest five points but hauled in 16 boards, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and posted one block.

The Nets (15 - 56) came into Thursday on what could, by their standards, be considered a hot streak. They'd tallied five victories in 12 games in March but they were chasing a particularly significant win against the Suns (22 - 50). Brooklyn had not prevailed in consecutive games in nearly a calendar year, improbable as that sounds. Early on, it appeared the dubious streak would endure, as the Nets fell by a 32 - 22 margin after one quarter. However, they roared back in the second by outscoring Phoenix by a 30 - 18 margin and then took it up a couple of notches in the second half. The Nets outscored their visitors, 74 - 48, over the third and fourth quarters for one of their biggest victories of the season. A whopping eight players hit double digits in the scoring column, and Brooklyn played a stellar defensive game overall, limiting the Suns to a 37 percent success rate from the field and 29 percent figure from three - point range while also causing 19 turnovers. Phoenix was led by Devin Booker, who managed 28 points, two rebounds and three steals. Marquese Chriss continued his recent stretch of excellent play with 23 points, 11 rebounds, two steals and one block. Alex Len followed with an 11 - point, 11 - rebound double - double that also included one assist, two steals and two blocks. Tyler Ulis chipped in with a 10 - point, 12 - assist double - double that also featured a pair of steals. Leandro Barbosa paced the second unit with 11 points, six boards, one assist and one steal. Brook Lopez led the way for the Nets with 19 points, six rebounds and one block. K.J. McDaniels followed with a bench - leading 16 points, which he supplemented with eight rebounds, one assist, two steals and one block. Trevor Booker managed 14 points, eight boards and one assist. Jeremy Lin tallied 13 points, five assists and three rebounds. Archie Goodwin and Quincy Acy contributed matching 12 - point efforts as reserves. Isaiah Whitehead compiled 11 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals and one block over 28 minutes. Justin Hamilton supplied 10 points and one rebound. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson mustered a modest five points but hauled in 16 boards, dished out two assists, recorded two steals and posted one block.

The Grizzlies (34 - 23) came in to Monday's contest a bit short - handed, as Tony Allen was given the night off to rest his 35 - year - old body. Memphis took advantage of their matchup against the worst team in the league to rest their defensive stalwart, but lately, the Nets (9 - 46) have played hard regardless of the circumstances. That transpired once again Monday, as Brooklyn shot a very respectable 46 percent from the field and committed a relatively modest 12 turnovers, significantly less than their average. However, Mike Conley took the reins of the Grizzlies offense with a 32 - point, six - assist, one - rebound, one - steal performance over 37 minutes, while also making a game - high 11 visits to the free - throw line. Five players hit double digits in the scoring column for the visitors, and they shot 51 percent from the field overall. Marc Gasol checked in second with a near double - double of 19 points, nine rebounds, eight assists, one steal and one block. Brandan Wright stepped in with a season - high 17 points that paced the bench, a total he supplemented with three rebounds, one assist and one steal over 21 minutes. Vince Carter supplied 14 points, three rebounds, one assist and two steals as a reserve. JaMychal Green totaled 10 points and six boards. James Ennis drew the start for Allen but generated a modest five points and five rebounds Brook Lopez and Spencer Dinwiddie led Brooklyn with matching 17 - point efforts, with the former dishing out five assists, hauling in three rebounds and recording a steal, and the latter providing three boards and one assist. Sean Kilpatrick led the bench with 15 points, six rebounds, three assists and one steal. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson collected 13 points, three boards, two assists and two steals. Trevor Booker matched Hollis-Jefferson's scoring total and added four rebounds and a steal. Bojan Bogdanovic submitted 11 points, five rebounds and two assists. The Grizzlies head back home to face off with the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday evening, while the Nets remain home to tangle with the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Grizzlies's Wins?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds.

The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds.

The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds.

The Nuggets shot much better than the Pelicans in this game, going 46 percent from the field and an impressive 59 percent from the three - point line, while the Pelicans shot 39 percent from the floor and just 20 percent from beyond the arc. The Pelicans out - rebounded the Nuggets 48 - 39, but it was n't enough to overcome a poor overall shooting performance, as they dropped a tough loss at home. Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds.

Arron Afflalo got hot from the floor for the Nuggets, going 7 - for - 13 from the field and 4 - for - 7 from the three - point line to score a team - high of 20 points. It was his second solid game in a row, combining for 38 points and 10 assists over that span. Jusuf Nurkic came just shy of a double - double, finishing with 15 points (7 - 9 FG, 1 - 2 FT), nine rebounds and two blocked shots. He has n't been doing much scoring for the Nuggets so far this season, as he's averaging only 7 points per game on the year, so the 15 points were a nice surprise. In 32 minutes, Kenneth Faried reached double figures as well, scoring 14 points (6 - 11 FG, 2 - 3 FT), while also adding seven rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot. It marked his second straight night with 14 points, pushing his season average to 12 points per game. Ty Lawson really struggled offensively, scoring only five points (2 - 12 FG, 1 - 2 3Pt), but also recorded 13 assists, as he found his teammates at a high rate. Tyreke Evans and Anthony Davis were the most successful players for the Pelicans despite the loss. Evans posted 25 points (11 - 22 FG, 1 - 4 3Pt, 2 - 3 FT), six rebounds and a steal, while Davis recorded 24 points (8 - 15 FG, 8 - 10 FT), 12 rebounds and two blocked shots. Davis has recorded four double - doubles in a row, averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds over that span of games. Davis had to leave the game late in the third quarter with a groin injury, but came back in the fourth and did n't seem to have any issues with it following that. Evans posted only six points in Monday's game against the Philadelphia 76ers, so it was good to see him get back on track with a very solid 25 - point game. Both Eric Gordon and Ryan Anderson reached double figures in points as well. Gordon had 11 points (4 - 15 FG, 2 - 6 3Pt, 1 - 2 FT), six rebounds and six assists, while Anderson posted 11 points (3 - 10 FG, 0 - 3 3Pt, 5 - 5 FT) and seven rebounds. The Nuggets' next game will be on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, while the Pelicans will be at home against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Nuggets's Rebounds?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Reigning MVP Steph Curry went 0 - for - 10 from beyond the arc, failing to hit a three - pointer for the first time in 157 games. As the NBA record fell, Curry's backcourt partner Klay Thompson saw struggles of his own, going just 2 - of - 10 from downtown. On the whole, the Warriors went just 5 - of - 32 from beyond the arc, their lowest three - point output of the season. Rebounding proved to be another major factor in the game. Los Angeles forward Julius Randle pulled down a season - high 14 boards, helping to give the Lakers a 51 - 40 rebounding advantage. Sophomore Larry Nance Jr. also provided a force in the paint, contributing nine rebounds and 12 points on perfect shooting.\\n    Value scope: <class 'int'>\\n    Question: What's the value of Warriors's Wins?\\n    Answer:\\n\",\n",

Los Angeles fell behind early, and aside from a late second quarter run, they were never able to come within striking distance. It proved to be another Kobe Bryant filled atmosphere, as the 20 year veteran played his last game in Portland. Bryant finished with 10 points on nine shots. No Lakers player received more than 30 minutes of playing time, and coach Byron Scott experimented with a variety of lineups throughout the game. D’Angelo Russell put forth one of his best campaigns during his rookie season and finished with 21 points (8 - of - 12 FG, 1 - of - 2 3PT, 4 - of - 5 FT), three rebounds and two assists coming off the bench. Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson combined for 26 point, while Julius Randle added 11 points and nine rebounds. The Lakers are now owners of a six game losing streak. Los Angeles will host the Dallas Mavericks (25 - 20) on Monday. Portland entered the contest with a major matchup advantage in the backcourt and Damian LIllard and CJ McCollum shot lights out as a result. Lillard led all scorers with 36 points (14 - of - 19 FG, 5 - of - 8 3PT, 3 - of - 4 FT) and constantly kept the Lakers out of reach. McCollum added 28 points on 50 percent shooting and the combo guards were simply too much to handle, as it helped the Blazers successfully outrun their opponents, both in transition and in the half court offense. Portland dominated the glass and won the rebounding battle 42 - 30, led by a balanced mix of starters and bench players. Mason Plumlee totaled 13 points and eight rebounds, Noah Venloe added 11 points and six rebounds and Ed Davis contributed eight boards off the bench.

Lillard led all scorers with 36 points (14 - of - 19 FG, 5 - of - 8 3PT, 3 - of - 4 FT) and constantly kept the Lakers out of reach. McCollum added 28 points on 50 percent shooting and the combo guards were simply too much to handle, as it helped the Blazers successfully outrun their opponents, both in transition and in the half court offense. Portland dominated the glass and won the rebounding battle 42 - 30, led by a balanced mix of starters and bench players. Mason Plumlee totaled 13 points and eight rebounds, Noah Venloe added 11 points and six rebounds and Ed Davis contributed eight boards off the bench.

Lou Williams and Jordan Clarkson combined for 26 point, while Julius Randle added 11 points and nine rebounds. The Lakers are now owners of a six game losing streak.
